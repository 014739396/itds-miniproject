L146393	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Oh?
L146392	u4646	m308	LETTY	I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
L146391	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	It was just a little going-away gesture.
L146390	u4646	m308	LETTY	OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
L146389	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
L146377	u4646	m308	LETTY	Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
L146376	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
L146375	u4646	m308	LETTY	What?
L146374	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Then, you should call.
L146373	u4646	m308	LETTY	I thought about calling, but I want to wait until I know when I'll be out.
L146372	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
L146371	u4646	m308	LETTY	But what I really can't believe is that I'm starting to actually miss work.
L146196	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
L146195	u4646	m308	LETTY	First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
L146194	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't want to hear anymore.
L146193	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
L146192	u4646	m308	LETTY	Look, I know he's almost through with treatment here. And, he's on medication.
L146191	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Then that's even more reason to listen. Look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. They experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes. 
L146190	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't need a lecture.   I care about Michael.
L146189	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
L146188	u4646	m308	LETTY	I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
L146187	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
L146186	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I can take care of myself.
L146185	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
L146184	u4646	m308	LETTY	I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
L146117	u4646	m308	LETTY	I miss Beast a lot, too.
L146116	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	The question, Letty, is how are you feeling?
L146115	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
L146114	u4646	m308	LETTY	The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
L146037	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
L146036	u4646	m308	LETTY	Do we have to talk about this?
L145954	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't think you understand.    I won't wait.
L145953	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	We discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you've experienced.
L145952	u4646	m308	LETTY	I want to see my mother immediately.
L145951	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
L145950	u4646	m308	LETTY	What kind of place is this?
L145949	u4646	m308	LETTY	What?
L145948	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Patient.
L145947	u4646	m308	LETTY	Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
L145946	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
L145945	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah, and a dimple.
L145944	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	This doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
L145943	u4646	m308	LETTY	Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
L145942	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
L145941	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	It's hospital policy...
L145940	u4646	m308	LETTY	I did this already.
L145939	u4645	m308	DR. EMLEE	Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
L146586	u4653	m308	RUTH	I know.    I know.
L146585	u4646	m308	LETTY	I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
L146584	u4646	m308	LETTY	I can't.    I can't see him there.
L146583	u4653	m308	RUTH	Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
L146582	u4646	m308	LETTY	But what am I going to do?
L146581	u4653	m308	RUTH	You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
L146580	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
L146577	u4646	m308	LETTY	I ruined your wedding night.
L146576	u4653	m308	RUTH	You did the right thing.
L146533	u4653	m308	RUTH	That's thanks to all your help.
L146532	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't think people even noticed. I thought the ceremony was perfect.
L146140	u4646	m308	LETTY	I didn't say...
L146139	u4653	m308	RUTH	What's his name, Letty?
L146135	u4653	m308	RUTH	Oh, no, of course not.
L146134	u4646	m308	LETTY	Do we have to talk wedding details?
L146133	u4653	m308	RUTH	And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
L146132	u4646	m308	LETTY	Ecru.
L146131	u4653	m308	RUTH	What do you think?
L146130	u4653	m308	RUTH	Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
L146129	u4646	m308	LETTY	You're slowing.
L146128	u4653	m308	RUTH	I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
L146127	u4646	m308	LETTY	That settles it. I'm never leaving.
L146126	u4653	m308	RUTH	Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
L146125	u4646	m308	LETTY	I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
L145896	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'll be back before you can say souffle.
L145895	u4653	m308	RUTH	Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
L145887	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, no. They've got to be Puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that doesn't overpower the palate.
L145886	u4653	m308	RUTH	It'll be fine.
L145885	u4646	m308	LETTY	Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
L145884	u4653	m308	RUTH	What's all the dreck?
L145881	u4653	m308	RUTH	What's the matter?
L145880	u4646	m308	LETTY	Fuck me.
L145877	u4653	m308	RUTH	What about the souffle?    Has that gone in?
L145876	u4646	m308	LETTY	Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
L145875	u4653	m308	RUTH	How can I help?
L145855	u4646	m308	LETTY	Do you think I should?
L145854	u4653	m308	RUTH	Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
L145845	u4653	m308	RUTH	Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
L145844	u4646	m308	LETTY	Hi, Mom.
L145843	u4646	m308	LETTY	Truly.
L145842	u4653	m308	RUTH	Really?
L145841	u4646	m308	LETTY	You look beautiful.
L145840	u4653	m308	RUTH	What about this one?
L145838	u4653	m308	RUTH	Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
L145837	u4646	m308	LETTY	Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
L145836	u4653	m308	RUTH	What about the engagement party?
L145835	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah, everything's under control.
L145834	u4653	m308	RUTH	But everything's OK?
L145833	u4646	m308	LETTY	Things have been kind of stressful lately.
L145831	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'd have to see it on.
L145830	u4653	m308	RUTH	What do you think of this one?
L145829	u4646	m308	LETTY	She said she'd be here at 10.
L145828	u4653	m308	RUTH	Where's the old bag I sometimes call Mommy?
L145778	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah, it'll be fun.
L145777	u4653	m308	RUTH	And the party?
L145776	u4646	m308	LETTY	You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
L145775	u4653	m308	RUTH	Really?
L145774	u4646	m308	LETTY	Maybe, though. Maybe it would work. I could throw you an engagement party maybe.
L145773	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
L145772	u4653	m308	RUTH	Please, Letty.
L145771	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh, wait a minute, now I see where you're going.
L145770	u4653	m308	RUTH	You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
L145769	u4646	m308	LETTY	Maybe.
L145768	u4653	m308	RUTH	Maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
L145767	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
L145766	u4653	m308	RUTH	How?
L145765	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
L145764	u4653	m308	RUTH	She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
L145729	u4646	m308	LETTY	Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
L145728	u4653	m308	RUTH	No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
L145725	u4653	m308	RUTH	There's nothing to tell.
L145724	u4646	m308	LETTY	Just go ahead and tell us.
L145720	u4653	m308	RUTH	Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
L145719	u4646	m308	LETTY	What's up with you?
L146522	u4646	m308	LETTY	Just remember that I love him.
L146521	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Don't be fresh.
L146520	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
L146518	u4646	m308	LETTY	He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
L146517	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
L146516	u4646	m308	LETTY	Michael just got a job.    Couldn't you congratulate him?
L146386	u4646	m308	LETTY	A deal's a deal.
L146385	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Honestly, Letty.
L146383	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Not even if it's something positive?
L146382	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.
L146381	u4646	m308	LETTY	I've already made arrangements.
L146380	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
L146379	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's good exercise, Mom.
L146378	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Must you walk so quickly?
L146259	u4646	m308	LETTY	And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
L146258	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I'm only looking out for you.
L146257	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
L146256	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
L146255	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom, please.
L146254	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic.
L146251	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	When did you start smoking?
L146250	u4646	m308	LETTY	I haven't had a crush since I was
L146249	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
L146248	u4646	m308	LETTY	We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom.
L146246	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
L146245	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
L146244	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
L146243	u4646	m308	LETTY	Which flowers did you order?
L146241	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
L146240	u4646	m308	LETTY	You too, Mom.
L146239	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
L146007	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
L146006	u4646	m308	LETTY	Tomorrow?
L146005	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I'll see you soon.
L146001	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
L146000	u4646	m308	LETTY	And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
L145999	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Ruth's already taken him home.
L145998	u4646	m308	LETTY	But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
L145997	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Yes.
L145996	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
L145995	u4646	m308	LETTY	Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
L145994	u4646	m308	LETTY	I just want to go home.   Can we go home now?
L145993	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
L145992	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
L145991	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
L145990	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
L145989	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Oh, Letty, what happened?
L145988	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
L145987	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
L145859	u4646	m308	LETTY	Can I get you a glass of champagne?
L145858	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	I gather he's late as usual.
L145853	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Especially with a promotion in the offing.
L145852	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mom, please.
L145851	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Paul could pop the question at any time.
L145850	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh no.
L145848	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, not yet. But you know Paul. He's sure to get it.
L145847	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Has Paul heard about his promotion?
L145736	u4646	m308	LETTY	You've only known Jake a few months.
L145735	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Tell us every detail.
L145733	u4646	m308	LETTY	Wow.   Congratulations.
L145732	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
L145727	u4646	m308	LETTY	Come on.
L145726	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Are you sure, Dear?
L145718	u4646	m308	LETTY	Not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
L145717	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	Will you get time off to do that?
L145716	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'll be running it three days a week, and...
L145715	u4649	m308	MRS. MAYER	How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
L146175	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	I'm glad.
L146174	u4646	m308	LETTY	You've been so great. I just feel a lot clearer about things.
L146173	u4646	m308	LETTY	I guess so. I think that's right.
L146172	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	You can only do what feels best to you now.
L146168	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
L146167	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't mean to go on and on like this.
L146162	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	I understand you just got engaged. Maybe that's where we should start.
L146161	u4646	m308	LETTY	To talk?  Well, OK, that might be good.
L146160	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	If you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
L146159	u4646	m308	LETTY	Lie?
L146158	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
L146157	u4646	m308	LETTY	Mottled really.   Green and red.
L146156	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	Green spot.
L146155	u4646	m308	LETTY	It had this red spot on its back.
L146153	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	Sounds awful. I guess we better check it out.
L146152	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
L146151	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	Yeah?
L146150	u4646	m308	LETTY	There's a spider in my room.
L146149	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	Letty, you should be in bed.
L145972	u4650	m308	NURSE GATES	Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
L145971	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm really not that hungry.
L146642	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You should go.
L146641	u4646	m308	LETTY	I guess I should go now.
L146639	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
L146638	u4646	m308	LETTY	Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
L146637	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
L146636	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	How about something better?   Like a kiss.
L146635	u4646	m308	LETTY	Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
L146634	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
L146633	u4646	m308	LETTY	Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
L146632	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
L146631	u4646	m308	LETTY	I love you so much.
L146628	u4646	m308	LETTY	I know I don't want to lose you.     I don't think I could stand it.
L146627	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	What do you want to do?
L146626	u4646	m308	LETTY	What are we going to do?
L146625	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh, God, Michael, I know.  Why does everything have to be so hard?
L146624	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
L146623	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.
L146622	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I don't know. I don't fucking know.
L146621	u4646	m308	LETTY	Well then why'd it happen?
L146620	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
L146619	u4646	m308	LETTY	Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
L146618	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
L146617	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Letty, please.
L146616	u4646	m308	LETTY	I've been thinking I could try to visit you at night after work, and then there'd be more time on weekends to see...
L146615	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Yeah, the plans.
L146614	u4646	m308	LETTY	And all the plans we have.
L146613	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I sure know what that feels like.
L146611	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's hard to know where to start.
L146610	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I guess so.
L146609	u4646	m308	LETTY	I guess we need to talk.
L146569	u4646	m308	LETTY	Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
L146568	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.
L146567	u4646	m308	LETTY	I think I should call someone.
L146566	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Silly, silly, silly.
L146565	u4646	m308	LETTY	Michael, take it easy.
L146564	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Silly?   Silly am I?
L146563	u4646	m308	LETTY	I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
L146562	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Why'd you tell?
L146561	u4646	m308	LETTY	What do you mean not taking your meds?
L146560	u4646	m308	LETTY	We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
L146559	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I saw you talking to my Mom.
L146558	u4646	m308	LETTY	What?
L146557	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Always the drugs.
L146556	u4646	m308	LETTY	What is it? Are you OK?
L146549	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It wasn't exactly a lie.
L146548	u4646	m308	LETTY	Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
L146546	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	How about a dance?
L146545	u4646	m308	LETTY	When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
L146544	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Something like that.
L146530	u4646	m308	LETTY	Bingo.
L146529	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Aunt Lily?
L146527	u4646	m308	LETTY	You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
L146526	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
L146525	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
L146524	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Aunt Lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
L146514	u4646	m308	LETTY	Congratulations.
L146513	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	How may I help you?
L146512	u4646	m308	LETTY	I got worried. Are you OK?
L146511	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
L146501	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Coming.
L146500	u4646	m308	LETTY	You're going to miss the Top Ten.
L146499	u4646	m308	LETTY	I think you know I'd love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
L146498	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Just promise you'll love me even if I end up in a job where I have to wear a blue polyester cap.
L146496	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You don't have to take care of me, you know.
L146495	u4646	m308	LETTY	That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
L146494	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I couldn't even face that one.
L146493	u4646	m308	LETTY	The restaurant, too?
L146492	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Four interviews. Four no-gos.
L146480	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
L146479	u4646	m308	LETTY	Are you OK?
L146478	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I think I should go home.
L146477	u4646	m308	LETTY	You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
L146476	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Would you mind if we just called it an early night?
L146475	u4646	m308	LETTY	You got wine. That's great.
L146474	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	The store was busy.
L146469	u4646	m308	LETTY	Steak?
L146468	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Promise.  As long as we have steak.
L146467	u4646	m308	LETTY	Promise?
L146466	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
L146465	u4646	m308	LETTY	Who ever said sanity was fun?
L146464	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah.    How was the job search?
L146463	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Sounds grim.
L146462	u4646	m308	LETTY	I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
L146461	u4646	m308	LETTY	That's Mr. Beast to you.
L146460	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	This must be Beast.
L146459	u4646	m308	LETTY	Thanks.
L146458	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
L146439	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You've got one hell of a great body.
L146438	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah?
L146437	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
L146435	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You, too. Kick ass today.
L146434	u4646	m308	LETTY	Good luck.
L146433	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I'll see you tonight.
L146432	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
L146430	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I'll be forced to tickle you.
L146429	u4646	m308	LETTY	Not yet.
L146427	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Shhhh.
L146426	u4646	m308	LETTY	Michael.
L146425	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	No.
L146424	u4646	m308	LETTY	Did I get spaghetti sauce on my face?
L146422	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's sex time.
L146421	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Hey.
L146420	u4646	m308	LETTY	You're so wrong.
L146419	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I like it.     But Headlines are better.
L146418	u4646	m308	LETTY	How can you not like the Top 10 List?
L146417	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
L146416	u4646	m308	LETTY	What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
L146415	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Really?
L146414	u4646	m308	LETTY	I love your apartment.
L146413	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Do you like it?
L146412	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You've got to see the kitchen first.
L146411	u4646	m308	LETTY	Let's try out the bed.
L146410	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
L146409	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's TV heaven.
L146408	u4646	m308	LETTY	Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
L146407	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
L146406	u4646	m308	LETTY	I love the pillows.
L146405	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You like it?
L146404	u4646	m308	LETTY	Wow.
L146402	u4646	m308	LETTY	Open up.    I want to see.
L146401	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
L146400	u4646	m308	LETTY	I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
L146399	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Where to?
L146398	u4646	m308	LETTY	Aren't you ever quiet?
L146397	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Aren't you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
L146362	u4646	m308	LETTY	List schmist. You'll remember.
L146361	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I better make a list.
L146360	u4646	m308	LETTY	First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
L146359	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	No, I need some serious household advice.
L146358	u4646	m308	LETTY	Furnished?
L146357	u4646	m308	LETTY	All over.  Did you see your new apartment?
L146356	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	So, it's over?
L146355	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah.
L146354	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the dirty deed?
L146353	u4646	m308	LETTY	Just checking.
L146352	u4646	m308	LETTY	And did you go to the mission?
L146351	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Not a one.
L146350	u4646	m308	LETTY	So there were no problems?
L146349	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
L146348	u4646	m308	LETTY	Tell me all.
L146346	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Home free.
L146345	u4646	m308	LETTY	Well?
L146309	u4646	m308	LETTY	Great. I came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
L146308	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
L146307	u4646	m308	LETTY	John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
L146305	u4646	m308	LETTY	But I do.     I love you, too.
L146304	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
L146303	u4646	m308	LETTY	Michael, I...
L146302	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I do.
L146301	u4646	m308	LETTY	Do you?
L146300	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	"You're right. I guess I was projecting. What I should have said is, ""It's a good thing I love you."""
L146299	u4646	m308	LETTY	Your family just met me.
L146298	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It's a good thing my family loves you.
L146297	u4646	m308	LETTY	Lie down.
L146296	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Then it's over.
L146295	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't like lamb.
L146294	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Tell the doctor.
L146293	u4646	m308	LETTY	I have a terrible confession.
L146292	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
L146291	u4646	m308	LETTY	And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
L146290	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I'd like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. And we'd get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
L146289	u4646	m308	LETTY	What else would you do?
L146287	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	That's where I always go when I get out.
L146286	u4646	m308	LETTY	No way.
L146285	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	The mission up in Santa Barbara.
L146284	u4646	m308	LETTY	I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
L146283	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
L146216	u4646	m308	LETTY	Break up?    They wish.
L146215	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
L146214	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
L146213	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
L146212	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I wish I could have seen that.
L146211	u4646	m308	LETTY	Sure. But I took out a whole grocery store.
L146210	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Shocking, huh?
L146209	u4646	m308	LETTY	What are the delusions like?
L146208	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
L146207	u4646	m308	LETTY	Schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
L146206	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	What's my rap?
L146205	u4646	m308	LETTY	Wow.    I'm bad news.
L146204	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
L146203	u4646	m308	LETTY	Really?    Me too.
L146202	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I'm not allowed to see you anymore.
L146201	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
L146200	u4646	m308	LETTY	Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
L146199	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	A rose is a rose.
L146198	u4646	m308	LETTY	The lady knows this is a dandelion.
L146197	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	A daisy for the lady.
L146148	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Rendezvous at the closet in 30.
L146147	u4646	m308	LETTY	Don't be ridiculous.
L146146	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Nervous? Scared? Worried you're not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
L146145	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	No rounds for another three hours.
L146144	u4646	m308	LETTY	We'll get caught.
L146143	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Exactly.
L146142	u4646	m308	LETTY	We're supposed to be asleep.
L146109	u4646	m308	LETTY	And I'm not covering for you when you sneak out to call Dominos.
L146108	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	No.
L146107	u4646	m308	LETTY	I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
L146106	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	A small price.
L146105	u4646	m308	LETTY	Good God.
L146104	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	For a price.
L146103	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	OK, OK, I'll give it back.
L146102	u4646	m308	LETTY	Really, this isn't funny.
L146098	u4646	m308	LETTY	The left one.
L146097	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Guess.
L146096	u4646	m308	LETTY	Enough with the abracadabra.
L146095	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Guess which hand.
L146093	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It's magic.
L146092	u4646	m308	LETTY	What have you done with the ring?
L146091	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	So are you engaged, or what?
L146090	u4646	m308	LETTY	It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
L146089	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Very romantic setting.
L146088	u4646	m308	LETTY	He asked me to marry him.
L146087	u4646	m308	LETTY	Paul.
L146086	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
L146085	u4646	m308	LETTY	Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
L146084	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
L146083	u4646	m308	LETTY	I wasn't hungry.
L146082	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
L146044	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I've already checked it out 17 times.
L146043	u4646	m308	LETTY	But you're checking it out.
L146042	u4646	m308	LETTY	Anything interesting.
L146041	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	What are you looking to read?
L146019	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm not the one who's masquerading as a doctor. I'm not the one who's, who's...
L146018	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Stop acting like you're someone special. You're just like the rest of us.
L146017	u4646	m308	LETTY	You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
L146016	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Don't take it personally.
L146015	u4646	m308	LETTY	Who do you think you are?
L146014	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It's no big deal.   We all compare.
L146013	u4646	m308	LETTY	You took bets on my diagnosis?
L146012	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	"Hey there. They're showing ""Groundhog Day"" if you..."
L145937	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	That must be really difficult.
L145936	u4646	m308	LETTY	A while, I guess.
L145935	u4646	m308	LETTY	Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
L145934	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	What if it's got a pattern?
L145933	u4646	m308	LETTY	By color.
L145932	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
L145931	u4646	m308	LETTY	Sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
L145930	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Yes?   Go right ahead.
L145928	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
L145927	u4646	m308	LETTY	No.
L145926	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Let me shift gears here a minute...  Do you ever hear voices that other people don't hear or see things they don't?
L145925	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Terrific.
L145924	u4646	m308	LETTY	Chair, cup and ball.
L145923	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
L145922	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
L145918	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
L145917	u4646	m308	LETTY	I answered these questions last night.
L145916	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
L145915	u4646	m308	LETTY	Letty.
L145914	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
L146602	u4646	m308	LETTY	Sure, I understand.
L146601	u4651	m308	PAUL	I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
L146600	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm really sorry.
L146599	u4651	m308	PAUL	I think I've heard this speech before.
L146598	u4646	m308	LETTY	Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.
L146597	u4646	m308	LETTY	Michael.   Yes.
L146596	u4651	m308	PAUL	I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
L146595	u4646	m308	LETTY	What?
L146594	u4651	m308	PAUL	I heard about your friend.
L146593	u4646	m308	LETTY	Getting back.
L146592	u4646	m308	LETTY	I start on Monday.
L146591	u4651	m308	PAUL	How's work going?    Are you back at school?
L146590	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh.
L146589	u4651	m308	PAUL	Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
L146588	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
L146587	u4651	m308	PAUL	I'm glad you agreed to see me.
L146342	u4651	m308	PAUL	No way. You keep the ring.     You'll come to your senses.
L146341	u4646	m308	LETTY	Here's the ring.
L146340	u4651	m308	PAUL	You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
L146339	u4646	m308	LETTY	I love him.
L146338	u4651	m308	PAUL	Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
L146337	u4646	m308	LETTY	He's a patient here.
L146336	u4651	m308	PAUL	It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
L146335	u4646	m308	LETTY	No.
L146334	u4651	m308	PAUL	Have you been seeing another teacher?
L146333	u4646	m308	LETTY	It doesn't matter who.
L146332	u4651	m308	PAUL	Who?
L146331	u4646	m308	LETTY	I've met someone else.
L146330	u4651	m308	PAUL	Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
L146329	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
L146328	u4651	m308	PAUL	You what?
L146327	u4651	m308	PAUL	That's a load off my mind.
L146326	u4646	m308	LETTY	No...
L146325	u4651	m308	PAUL	You can tell me anything.  Do you want to postpone the wedding? Is it too much pressure?
L146324	u4646	m308	LETTY	I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
L146323	u4651	m308	PAUL	What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
L146081	u4646	m308	LETTY	Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
L146080	u4651	m308	PAUL	So will you?
L146079	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, no.
L146078	u4651	m308	PAUL	Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
L146077	u4651	m308	PAUL	So, what do you say, Let?
L146076	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, you've done a perfect job.
L146075	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's, it's really nice, Paul.
L146074	u4651	m308	PAUL	I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
L146073	u4646	m308	LETTY	Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
L146072	u4651	m308	PAUL	I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
L146070	u4651	m308	PAUL	I just wish we'd done it sooner.
L146069	u4646	m308	LETTY	You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
L146068	u4651	m308	PAUL	Exactly. It's time to make decisions.
L146067	u4646	m308	LETTY	I know. We can't just keep going through the motions.
L146066	u4651	m308	PAUL	I talked to Ruth a little bit, and I think it's about time...
L146065	u4651	m308	PAUL	So, I've been thinking a lot...
L146064	u4646	m308	LETTY	Especially now.
L146063	u4651	m308	PAUL	Especially this last year.
L146062	u4646	m308	LETTY	No.
L146061	u4651	m308	PAUL	This has been really difficult, this whole thing. 
L146060	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yes, I suppose so.
L146059	u4651	m308	PAUL	I think we need to talk about some things.
L146058	u4646	m308	LETTY	Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?
L146057	u4646	m308	LETTY	Something you did?
L146056	u4651	m308	PAUL	I hope it wasn't something I did.
L146055	u4646	m308	LETTY	That's a big question.
L146054	u4651	m308	PAUL	Are you all right?
L146053	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah, I guess it's all right.
L146052	u4651	m308	PAUL	It's prettier here than I thought it would be.
L145894	u4651	m308	PAUL	I think you're overreacting.
L145893	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm going to the store.
L145892	u4651	m308	PAUL	Sure. Why?
L145891	u4646	m308	LETTY	Can you loan me a 20?
L145890	u4651	m308	PAUL	What are you doing?
L145872	u4651	m308	PAUL	Yes.
L145871	u4646	m308	LETTY	You know what I think we need? Martinis. How about martinis to celebrate?
L145811	u4651	m308	PAUL	You just need to get more organized. L
L145810	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah.
L145809	u4651	m308	PAUL	Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
L145808	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't think so.
L145807	u4651	m308	PAUL	Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
L145806	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
L145805	u4651	m308	PAUL	You can get out of the dinner.
L145804	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
L145803	u4646	m308	LETTY	No, it's not like that.
L145802	u4651	m308	PAUL	Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
L145801	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
L145800	u4651	m308	PAUL	Forget I asked.
L145799	u4646	m308	LETTY	Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
L145798	u4651	m308	PAUL	But what about that math project?
L145797	u4651	m308	PAUL	Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
L145796	u4646	m308	LETTY	I don't feel like going to work today.
L145795	u4651	m308	PAUL	You don't have a fever.
L145794	u4646	m308	LETTY	I'm calling in sick.
L145793	u4651	m308	PAUL	What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
L145756	u4646	m308	LETTY	Sure. Of course.
L145755	u4651	m308	PAUL	But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
L145754	u4646	m308	LETTY	Oh, ok.   Maybe.
L145753	u4651	m308	PAUL	Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
L145752	u4646	m308	LETTY	I mean tonight.
L145751	u4651	m308	PAUL	I was thinking dinner on Friday with James and Meg at the Saint Mark.
L145750	u4651	m308	PAUL	Huntley told me today that if I come through on the Benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
L145749	u4646	m308	LETTY	Yeah?
L145748	u4651	m308	PAUL	Good going. I knew you could do it.
L145747	u4646	m308	LETTY	My math program. The Superintendent said he'd fund it.
L145746	u4651	m308	PAUL	The receptionist said you called earlier about something.
L145745	u4646	m308	LETTY	Believe me, I know your feelings on the matter.
L145744	u4651	m308	PAUL	I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
L145743	u4646	m308	LETTY	In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
L145742	u4651	m308	PAUL	Can I put these here for tonight?
L145741	u4651	m308	PAUL	She's only known the guy a few months.
L145740	u4646	m308	LETTY	It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
L145739	u4651	m308	PAUL	So, another one bites the dust.
L146452	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
L146451	u4646	m308	LETTY	Office work?
L146450	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	I need someone to work on budget projections.
L146449	u4646	m308	LETTY	What does that mean?
L146448	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
L146446	u4646	m308	LETTY	I've already thought about how to tell the kids where I was.
L146445	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	I'm glad you're doing well.
L146444	u4646	m308	LETTY	Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
L146443	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
L146442	u4646	m308	LETTY	Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
L146441	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
L146440	u4646	m308	LETTY	Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
L145701	u4646	m308	LETTY	I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
L145700	u4652	m308	PRINCIPAL GAIL	The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
L146266	u4648	m308	MRS. HALLSTROM	That's so sweet, Michael. But, really, I've so many things to do.
L146265	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join my family for dinner. You'll love my Grandma Rosa.
L146182	u4648	m308	MRS. HALLSTROM	Simulated sapphires. I bet my daughter would love those, too.
L146181	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I like those sapphire earrings myself.
L146180	u4648	m308	MRS. HALLSTROM	Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
L146179	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	How's it look?
L145967	u4647	m308	MICHAEL	I'll float you.
L145966	u4648	m308	MRS. HALLSTROM	All tapped out.
L463269	u7230	m488	SCHOOL-MARM	... okay... you made your point.
L463268	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
L463267	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Maybe I'm not making myself clear. You're probably the first girl Billy-Boy's ever fallen in love with, and I know for sure you're the first he's slept with.  So, how's he gonna feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who didn't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
L463266	u7230	m488	SCHOOL-MARM	What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
L463265	u7237	m488	KITTLE	You're not gonna see him again.
L463264	u7230	m488	SCHOOL-MARM	Let me tell him.  Let him decide.
L463262	u7230	m488	SCHOOL-MARM	But... I love him.  I do...
L463261	u7237	m488	KITTLE	What were you gonna say?  Exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
L463260	u7230	m488	SCHOOL-MARM	I was going to tell him.
L463259	u7237	m488	KITTLE	I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
L463258	u7230	m488	SCHOOL-MARM	I... I can explain...
L463401	u7231	m488	ADAM	Fair enough.
L463400	u7237	m488	KITTLE	We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
L463398	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
L463397	u7231	m488	ADAM	Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
L463396	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Careful she doesn't hit her head on the way.
L463395	u7231	m488	ADAM	Alright, wait... there's a dentist in Brentwood peddling morphine...
L463394	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Who cares?
L463393	u7231	m488	ADAM	Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
L463392	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
L463390	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
L463389	u7231	m488	ADAM	Have I ever steered you wrong?
L463386	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
L463385	u7231	m488	ADAM	Now you know what to watch for...
L463384	u7237	m488	KITTLE	A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
L463383	u7231	m488	ADAM	What and?  That's what I got.
L463382	u7237	m488	KITTLE	And... ?
L463381	u7231	m488	ADAM	Okay, man, okay.  I'm with you.  I... I heard how the shit's arriving...  It's coming in a Lincoln.
L463380	u7237	m488	KITTLE	You get nothing and like it.  And if we're not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
L463378	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
L463377	u7231	m488	ADAM	I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
L463376	u7237	m488	KITTLE	You think it's that good?
L463375	u7231	m488	ADAM	I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
L463374	u7237	m488	KITTLE	How much?
L463373	u7231	m488	ADAM	A little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you're chasing.  It's up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
L463372	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Put up your kickstand, freak.  Start talking, or we're out the door.
L463371	u7231	m488	ADAM	What Eve and I wouldn't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
L463370	u7231	m488	ADAM	Every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  What's wrong, Kittle?  You don't swing?
L463369	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Incestuous.
L463368	u7231	m488	ADAM	Indivisible and inseparable.
L463441	u7232	m488	ARCHIE	Abe Lincoln...
L463440	u7237	m488	KITTLE	What... ?
L463439	u7232	m488	ARCHIE	Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
L463436	u7237	m488	KITTLE	You don't.  It's a gamble.  But, not even in Vegas are you gonna get close to this kind of cash.  This is <U>two million</U>, Archie.  It's not three houses, it's twelve.  It's dreams come true.
L463435	u7232	m488	ARCHIE	If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
L463434	u7237	m488	KITTLE	It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
L463354	u7232	m488	ARCHIE	I don't know.  Fuck off!
L463353	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Well, I'm running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you don't know!  Convince me!
L463352	u7232	m488	ARCHIE	I'm telling you, you're barking up the wrong tree.
L463351	u7237	m488	KITTLE	You're Zimmermann's calculator, Archie.  All the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  Maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you weren't supposed to hear...
L463349	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Just entering.  We'll get to the breaking in a minute.
L463348	u7232	m488	ARCHIE	This is private property.  This is breaking and entering!
L462899	u7233	m488	BENNY	I don't know, okay?  All I know is Butch Cassidy's back in town.
L462898	u7237	m488	KITTLE	"I need the ""when"" and the ""where."""
L462897	u7233	m488	BENNY	It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
L462896	u7233	m488	BENNY	Alright!  Alright... put me down...
L462895	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
L462893	u7237	m488	KITTLE	This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
L462892	u7233	m488	BENNY	I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
L462891	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
L462890	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Again.
L462889	u7233	m488	BENNY	Hey now... what the fuck... ?
L462884	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
L462883	u7233	m488	BENNY	Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
L462880	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Really?  Is that a fact... ?
L462879	u7233	m488	BENNY	What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.
L462877	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
L462876	u7233	m488	BENNY	Kittle...
L463523	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	Yeah.  Happy Fourth of July.
L463522	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Happy Independence Day.
L463495	u7237	m488	KITTLE	I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
L463494	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	You don't smoke.
L463493	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Gimmie a butt.
L463458	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	Feeling great.
L463457	u7237	m488	KITTLE	How you doing back there?

L463249	u7238	m488	NENA	Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
L463248	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
L463189	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	Then, why'd we tie him up?
L463188	u7238	m488	NENA	This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
L463187	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	No, we're stealing.
L463186	u7238	m488	NENA	We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.

L462919	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	It doesn't say that.
L462918	u7238	m488	NENA	Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear.
L462917	u7234	m488	BILLY-BOY	What's mine say?

L462867	u7238	m488	NENA	You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...

L463205	u7235	m488	CAPTAIN ALBERT	There was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.

L463084	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Hey now, look!  Let's all get on the same page here.  This shipment is do or die for Zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  If we stop the drugs, we don't even have to catch him red-handed.  He's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  On the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that doesn't have a single empty drawer.  More old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while Zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
L463144	u7238	m488	NENA	Yes, sir.

L463093	u7236	m488	D.A. RAVICH	Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
L463092	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?

L463090	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Don't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor Independence Day, and don't tell me I'm overreacting when I'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
L463078	u7237	m488	KITTLE	What?
L463077	u7236	m488	D.A. RAVICH	Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.

L463075	u7236	m488	D.A. RAVICH	No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
L463074	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Well, sir...
L463073	u7236	m488	D.A. RAVICH	And, what... what am I forgetting? Oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
L463509	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
L463508	u7237	m488	KITTLE	It's our job.
L463507	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?

L463059	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	I insist.  What will it be?  Boston Tea Party Clam Chowder, or maybe the Chicken Red, White and Cordon Bleu? No...  There's a special on the menu, today only...  ... <U>roasted</U> <U>pig</U>.
L463058	u7237	m488	KITTLE	"Thanks, but we don't recognize ""brunch"" as an actual meal."
L463053	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	Murderer?  Really?
L463052	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
L463051	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
L463050	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Couldn't have said it better myself.
L463046	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	Thank you for sharing that charming image.
L463045	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
L463044	u7240	m488	ZIMMERMANN	What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
L463520	u7237	m488	KITTLE	Good.  Thought I was imagining them.

L462885	u7238	m488	NENA	Arriving tonight

L650059	u8870	m603	AARON	Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
L650058	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
L650057	u8870	m603	AARON	You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
L650055	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But why would they do that...?
L650054	u8870	m603	AARON	With his hands!
L649960	u8870	m603	AARON	Two heartbeats.
L649959	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Two what...?
L649958	u8870	m603	AARON	There are two.
L649957	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
L649956	u8870	m603	AARON	Are you alright...?  You look pale.
L649818	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
L649817	u8870	m603	AARON	Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
L649815	u8870	m603	AARON	But you've not told Michael.
L649814	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I have seen him again.  Last night.
L649794	u8870	m603	AARON	I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
L649793	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
L649792	u8870	m603	AARON	Thank you for this honor, my dear.
L649661	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
L649660	u8870	m603	AARON	Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
L649651	u8870	m603	AARON	A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
L649650	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Then what is he...?
L649649	u8870	m603	AARON	Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
L650156	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
L650155	u8870	m603	AARON	Rowan...
L650152	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
L650151	u8870	m603	AARON	What are you talk---
L650150	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
L650141	u8870	m603	AARON	Every day  twice.
L650140	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
L650138	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
L650137	u8870	m603	AARON	Nothing was ever more false.
L650136	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
L650053	u8870	m603	AARON	Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
L650052	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Go back, Michael.  Do what you can...
L650051	u8870	m603	AARON	What have the witches always asked of you...?
L650004	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
L650003	u8870	m603	AARON	Michael, Rowan should -
L650002	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Don't tell Rowan about this.
L649752	u8870	m603	AARON	Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
L649751	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan.
L649750	u8870	m603	AARON	There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
L649749	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
L649653	u8870	m603	AARON	A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
L649652	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	A what...?
L649520	u8870	m603	AARON	Come.  There is a lot to read
L649519	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
L649517	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
L649516	u8870	m603	AARON	I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
L649511	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
L649510	u8870	m603	AARON	With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
L649509	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
L649508	u8870	m603	AARON	Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
L649507	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
L649952	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
L649951	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
L649787	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
L649786	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Then you wear it.
L649785	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
L649784	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't want it.
L649783	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
L649719	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
L649718	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
L649717	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
L649705	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Nothing worse than a common tool.
L649704	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
L649703	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
L649702	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He made that quite clear, yes.
L649701	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
L649480	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I want to see my mother.
L649479	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
L649802	u8875	m603	GIFFORD	Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
L649801	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
L649800	u8875	m603	GIFFORD	"I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - ""make us rich"" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'"
L649799	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
L649497	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
L649496	u8875	m603	GIFFORD	In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
L649495	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
L649609	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
L649608	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
L649606	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
L649605	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You - are - a - murderer.
L649604	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
L649603	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
L649602	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
L649599	u8880	m603	ROWAN	ENOUGH!!!
L649598	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
L649597	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Stop it!
L649596	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
L649595	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It wes a dream...!
L649594	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Lasher touched you and you loved it.
L649591	u8880	m603	ROWAN	'He'...?
L649590	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
L649589	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
L649588	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
L649587	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
L649586	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You're a monster.
L649585	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	She didn't feel them
L649584	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
L649573	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
L649572	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Better than most, I suppose.
L649571	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
L649570	u8880	m603	ROWAN	The lamplight.  That's all.
L649569	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	What is it...?

L649543	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't want the -
L649526	u8880	m603	ROWAN	There are things I have to know!
L649525	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	I'm tired.  I need to rest.
L649524	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
L649523	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
L649522	u8880	m603	ROWAN	She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
L649486	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
L649485	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?

L649453	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
L649452	u8880	m603	ROWAN	When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
L649451	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
L649450	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
L649449	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
L649448	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Who the hel1 -

L649439	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.

L650222	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
L650221	u8876	m603	LASHER	Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
L650191	u8876	m603	LASHER	Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
L650190	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Oh god...
L650189	u8876	m603	LASHER	They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
L650188	u8880	m603	ROWAN	The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
L650187	u8876	m603	LASHER	It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
L650186	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
L650111	u8876	m603	LASHER	Tell me what I am, Rowan.
L650110	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No!
L650105	u8876	m603	LASHER	That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
L650104	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't know what you are!!!
L650103	u8876	m603	LASHER	There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
L650102	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
L650101	u8876	m603	LASHER	I do not understand...
L650100	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
L650099	u8876	m603	LASHER	What is wrong...?
L650098	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Leave me alone!
L650097	u8876	m603	LASHER	Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
L650078	u8876	m603	LASHER	Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
L650077	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Only you...
L650076	u8876	m603	LASHER	Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
L650075	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
L650074	u8876	m603	LASHER	Then help me--- for his sake...
L650073	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I love Michael...
L650072	u8876	m603	LASHER	--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
L650070	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But have I...?  Ever...?!
L650069	u8876	m603	LASHER	I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
L650066	u8876	m603	LASHER	No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
L650065	u8880	m603	ROWAN	And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
L650064	u8876	m603	LASHER	I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
L650063	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I know that you're evil.
L649989	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
L649988	u8876	m603	LASHER	Do not tell me that!
L649987	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I LOVE him!
L649986	u8876	m603	LASHER	But I could understand. I want to understand!
L649985	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
L649984	u8876	m603	LASHER	you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
L649982	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It's too soon to know.
L649981	u8876	m603	LASHER	A girl...?
L649980	u8876	m603	LASHER	From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
L649979	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
L649978	u8876	m603	LASHER	If that were true, I would not be here.
L649977	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Go away!  I don't want you here.
L649976	u8876	m603	LASHER	There is no one here but the dead.
L649975	u8876	m603	LASHER	I bring her flowers too.
L649974	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
L649940	u8876	m603	LASHER	I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
L649939	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You're very clever, aren't you...?
L649937	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
L649936	u8876	m603	LASHER	If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
L649935	u8876	m603	LASHER	If you knew how I yearn for that...
L649934	u8880	m603	ROWAN	To love, you must be able to feel.
L649933	u8876	m603	LASHER	It is from love.
L649932	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Made it...?
L649930	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You bastard...
L649929	u8876	m603	LASHER	Explain this to me --- violated...?

L649926	u8880	m603	ROWAN	The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
L649833	u8876	m603	LASHER	Always loved you..

L649825	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
L649770	u8876	m603	LASHER	There are things you will not tell him.

L649768	u8876	m603	LASHER	You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?

L650238	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
L650237	u8877	m603	LASHER THE MAN	ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
L650236	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
L650218	u8877	m603	LASHER THE MAN	How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?

L649763	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Their what...?
L649762	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
L649760	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
L649759	u8880	m603	ROWAN	That's GREAT!
L649758	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I took off my gloves today - with Aaron -  - and it was okay.
L649757	u8880	m603	ROWAN	And I thought I was the mindreader.
L649756	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
L649755	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
L649754	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
L649733	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No, I'm ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
L649732	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You're a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
L649729	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
L649728	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
L649727	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't think of us that way - ever.
L649726	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Ro, how long have we known each other.
L649725	u8880	m603	ROWAN	If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
L649724	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Maybe he's just - waiting...
L649723	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
L649722	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
L649709	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
L649708	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Hello..

L649691	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Let's see.
L649690	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'll bet she had a wonderful smile.
L649665	u8880	m603	ROWAN	They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
L649664	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	What about your work back home...?
L649663	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm soon to be a very wealthy witch.
L649662	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It'd take mounths... and cost a fortune.
L649659	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
L649658	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Yes.  I love you.  Very much.

L649655	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
L649654	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
L649643	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
L649642	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
L649641	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He's in there!  Or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
L649640	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	C'mon.  Let's go to the ho---
L649638	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
L649637	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
L649636	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - I saw him!  Twice!  Carlotta said I  ---  killed Graham - with - with my anger.
L649635	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
L649633	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	- a witch.
L649632	u8880	m603	ROWAN	She - she said I - I was a ---
L649631	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
L649630	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You know...?
L649465	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Goodbye, Michael.   I love you.
L649464	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?
L649463	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Go to LAX and get on a flight to New Orleans.  Go to the Ponchartrain Hotel and wait for me.  I'll call you there.
L649462	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	What about you coming down here...?
L649461	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - I have to go - to New Orleans. I'll - I'll call yati when I -

L649418	u8880	m603	ROWAN	We're quite a pair, you and I.
L649417	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
L649415	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
L649414	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	God knows, I'm intriguing.
L649413	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.
L649412	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - this place is increadible.  You - you're brilliant...  The things you created...
L649411	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Seems more like a year than a month.
L649407	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
L649406	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Stop it.
L649405	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
L649404	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm serious.  You don't -
L649403	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
L649402	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
L649401	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
L649400	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	All I meant was -
L649399	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
L649397	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Captain's orders.
L649396	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Doctor's orders- - -?
L649395	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
L649394	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Why don't you let at do that...?
L649392	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Okay.     y'all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
L649391	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Y-U-H-E-E-Y-A-H.  Yu-hee-yah...? No way, busters use it in a sentence.
L649390	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Ms. yin, and Mr. yang  Aha!
L649389	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
L649386	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
L649385	u8880	m603	ROWAN	you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
L649384	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	He fools around with his patients too.
L649383	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
L649380	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
L649379	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Too much... too fast...?
L649378	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
L649377	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Really...?  Your family there...?
L649376	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I was born, in New Orleans, too-
L649374	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You still feel that crazy...?
L649373	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
L649372	u8880	m603	ROWAN	And whose houses do you design...?
L649371	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	My mother and I used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  The Queen's house-. the Gangster's house-. the clown's house- Like that.
L649367	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
L649366	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It's unbelievable that you can do that.
L649365	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
L649364	u8880	m603	ROWAN	My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
L649363	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
L649362	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What else did you see- Michael...?
L649361	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
L649360	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	you're very --- different.
L649359	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Yessssss...
L649358	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
L649357	u8880	m603	ROWAN	HARDER!
L649356	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan...
L649355	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Harder...
L649348	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
L649347	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
L649346	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
L649345	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	The one time I want it to work...
L649344	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Just one.  The bar's closed.
L649343	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
L649342	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What do you see...?
L649339	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
L649338	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
L649336	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
L649335	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	My jury's still out on that,
L649334	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm glad you're around to say it.
L649333	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
L649332	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
L649331	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
L649330	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
L649329	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	They like you ------- kids.
L650085	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Just don't fall off any ladders.
L650084	u8883	m603	STU	A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
L650019	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
L650018	u8883	m603	STU	Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
L650017	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I'm getting --- left behind.
L649780	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?
L649779	u8883	m603	STU	You okay...?
L649677	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	If you like that type.
L649676	u8883	m603	STU	Wow...
L649674	u8883	m603	STU	That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
L649673	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
L649672	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
L649671	u8883	m603	STU	Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
L649315	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Go away, GODDAMNIT!
L649314	u8883	m603	STU	You can't just -
L649313	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	On which planet...?
L649312	u8883	m603	STU	Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
L649311	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
L649274	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I just - hate it when they're - finished.
L649273	u8883	m603	STU	sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
L650087	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
L650086	u8883	m603	STU	Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
L649910	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Is that what you were doing...?
L649909	u8883	m603	STU	Is that a crack about our singing...?
L649908	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
L649684	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I like him.  He can stay.
L649683	u8883	m603	STU	Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
L649682	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He's got great hands.
L649681	u8883	m603	STU	You really love this guy...?
L649680	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
L649679	u8883	m603	STU	Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
L649678	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Rowan Mayfair.
L649743	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
L649742	u8882	m603	RYAN	That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
L649741	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
L649740	u8882	m603	RYAN	That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
L649739	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I've decided not to open a practice here  I want to set up a research clinic.  For infant genetic disorder.
L649738	u8882	m603	RYAN	Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
L649737	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Papers...?
L649736	u8882	m603	RYAN	We'd better get to work on the papers.
