L295489	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	It's open...  What'll you have?
L295488	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Huh?
L295482	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	Right.
L295481	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Give me a bottle of beer.
L295298	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You look different... More relaxed.
L295297	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	Check!
L295296	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
L295288	u1416	m94	EDDIE	No.
L295287	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	You want a chaser?
L295286	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
L295082	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Next game, ten bucks.
L295081	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	About sixty, seventy bucks.
L295074	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
L295073	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
L295070	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	What do you guys sell?
L295069	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
L295068	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	Comin' in or goin' out?
L295067	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Mm hmm.
L295066	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	Pittsburgh?
L295065	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yep.
L295064	u1412	m94	BARTENDER	Boys just passing through?
L295911	u1420	m94	SARAH	Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
L295910	u1413	m94	BERT	All I want's the money.
L295909	u1420	m94	SARAH	And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
L295908	u1413	m94	BERT	That's the way it's done.
L295907	u1420	m94	SARAH	Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
L295906	u1413	m94	BERT	It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
L295905	u1420	m94	SARAH	In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
L295790	u1420	m94	SARAH	Thank you.
L295789	u1413	m94	BERT	Are you ready for another?
L295777	u1413	m94	BERT	You tell me.
L295776	u1420	m94	SARAH	How?
L295775	u1413	m94	BERT	I'll make it up to you.
L295774	u1413	m94	BERT	Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
L295773	u1420	m94	SARAH	You bastard.
L295772	u1413	m94	BERT	Well, nobody has to sell.
L295771	u1420	m94	SARAH	No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
L295770	u1413	m94	BERT	All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
L295769	u1420	m94	SARAH	You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
L295768	u1413	m94	BERT	For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
L295767	u1420	m94	SARAH	For whom and for what?
L295766	u1413	m94	BERT	To win.
L295765	u1420	m94	SARAH	You know what's good for him?
L295764	u1413	m94	BERT	Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
L295763	u1420	m94	SARAH	Do we need words?
L295762	u1413	m94	BERT	I want to talk to you.
L295761	u1420	m94	SARAH	We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
L295760	u1413	m94	BERT	Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
L295742	u1413	m94	BERT	She's a smart girl, Eddie.
L295741	u1420	m94	SARAH	And a fact is a fact.
L295740	u1413	m94	BERT	That's right, Miss Packard.
L295739	u1420	m94	SARAH	It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
L295735	u1413	m94	BERT	Oh, I forgot all about it.  How's the hands?
L295734	u1420	m94	SARAH	Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
L295732	u1413	m94	BERT	I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
L295731	u1420	m94	SARAH	What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
L295721	u1413	m94	BERT	Soon as I finish my coffee.
L295720	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm ready.
L295714	u1413	m94	BERT	Lots of action. Lots of money.  Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
L295713	u1420	m94	SARAH	I've never been to Louisville.
L295712	u1413	m94	BERT	You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
L295711	u1420	m94	SARAH	No, I'm fine.
L295710	u1413	m94	BERT	It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
L295709	u1420	m94	SARAH	Packard. Sarah Packard.
L295708	u1413	m94	BERT	You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
L295888	u1413	m94	BERT	Twelve thousand.
L295887	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	How much do I owe you?
L295886	u1413	m94	BERT	Cash.
L295885	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Will you take a check, Bert?
L295861	u1413	m94	BERT	The night is two thousand dollars old.
L295860	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	That seems a shame. The night is young.
L295854	u1413	m94	BERT	It's possible.
L295853	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
L295850	u1413	m94	BERT	I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
L295849	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
L295848	u1413	m94	BERT	Do you really think you can beat him?
L295847	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Oh, about five hundred.
L295846	u1413	m94	BERT	How much?
L295834	u1413	m94	BERT	Deal the cards.
L295833	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
L295830	u1413	m94	BERT	You ever played billiards before?
L295829	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
L295813	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Good, good.
L295812	u1413	m94	BERT	We'll be there.
L295805	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
L295804	u1413	m94	BERT	Could be.
L295962	u1416	m94	EDDIE	And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
L295961	u1413	m94	BERT	If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
L295960	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Boy, we really gave it to her good.
L295959	u1413	m94	BERT	Aaaahhhh!
L295958	u1416	m94	EDDIE	We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
L295957	u1413	m94	BERT	No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
L295956	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Fifty per cent?
L295955	u1413	m94	BERT	Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
L295954	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
L295953	u1413	m94	BERT	I'm a businessman, kid.
L295952	u1416	m94	EDDIE	So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
L295950	u1413	m94	BERT	You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
L295949	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
L295948	u1413	m94	BERT	Well, here it's half.
L295947	u1416	m94	EDDIE	In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
L295946	u1413	m94	BERT	Half.
L295945	u1416	m94	EDDIE	And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
L295944	u1413	m94	BERT	Eddie?...  YOU OWE ME MONEY!
L295903	u1413	m94	BERT	You gotta be hard, Eddie.
L295902	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Tell her what?
L295901	u1413	m94	BERT	You want me to tell her for you?
L295900	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I got time, Bert.
L295899	u1413	m94	BERT	It's a long walk.
L295898	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I wanna walk.
L295875	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
L295874	u1413	m94	BERT	I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
L295873	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Please don't get off me now.
L295866	u1416	m94	EDDIE	All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
L295865	u1413	m94	BERT	I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
L295864	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
L295863	u1413	m94	BERT	I said we're leavin'.
L295862	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
L295859	u1413	m94	BERT	Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
L295858	u1416	m94	EDDIE	They're fine.
L295857	u1413	m94	BERT	How're the hands?
L295856	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'll beat him the next game.
L295852	u1413	m94	BERT	All right. Five hundred.
L295851	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I can beat him.
L295843	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
L295842	u1413	m94	BERT	Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
L295841	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
L295840	u1413	m94	BERT	I don't know.
L295839	u1416	m94	EDDIE	When do I raise the bet?
L295838	u1413	m94	BERT	'Bout even.
L295837	u1416	m94	EDDIE	How do we stand?
L295832	u1413	m94	BERT	You hustlin' me?
L295831	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Sure.
L295828	u1413	m94	BERT	How much?
L295827	u1416	m94	EDDIE	C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
L295826	u1413	m94	BERT	Well, we won't.
L295819	u1413	m94	BERT	It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
L295818	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What's the matter? What happened?
L295800	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, I win sometimes.
L295799	u1413	m94	BERT	So does Eddie.
L295788	u1413	m94	BERT	Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
L295787	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
L295786	u1413	m94	BERT	Over there by the bar.
L295785	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Where?
L295784	u1413	m94	BERT	Hey, Findley's here.
L295753	u1413	m94	BERT	Come on, let's go...
L295752	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
L295738	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
L295737	u1413	m94	BERT	Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
L295736	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Fine.
L295730	u1413	m94	BERT	Play it again. Learn something.  Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
L295729	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
L295728	u1413	m94	BERT	Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
L295727	u1413	m94	BERT	No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
L295726	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Here, I got it.
L295725	u1413	m94	BERT	Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I'm finished.
L295724	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What's that supposed to mean?
L295723	u1413	m94	BERT	I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
L295722	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You must have a lot of confidence in me.
L295719	u1413	m94	BERT	I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
L295718	u1416	m94	EDDIE	How good is he?
L295717	u1413	m94	BERT	He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
L295716	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What? And he -- he hustles pool?
L295715	u1413	m94	BERT	James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
L295705	u1413	m94	BERT	Miss Packard. How do you do?
L295704	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
L295661	u1413	m94	BERT	Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
L295660	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
L295659	u1413	m94	BERT	Thinking about what?
L295658	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I been thinking.
L295657	u1413	m94	BERT	No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
L295656	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Like I told ya. My thumbs.
L295655	u1413	m94	BERT	What happened to you anyway?
L295654	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
L295653	u1413	m94	BERT	The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
L295652	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Where do I sign?
L295651	u1413	m94	BERT	Sign up.
L295650	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
L295649	u1413	m94	BERT	Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
L295648	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You know everybody, don't you?
L295647	u1413	m94	BERT	Man named Turk Baker?
L295646	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
L295645	u1413	m94	BERT	What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
L295644	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
L295643	u1413	m94	BERT	Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
L295642	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
L295641	u1413	m94	BERT	Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
L295640	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hi. How's business?
L295639	u1413	m94	BERT	Hello, Eddie.
L295562	u1413	m94	BERT	I don't know when it was.
L295561	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Now, when did you adopt me?
L295560	u1413	m94	BERT	Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
L295559	u1416	m94	EDDIE	There are places. I'll scuffle around.
L295558	u1413	m94	BERT	Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
L295557	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Kiss off.
L295556	u1413	m94	BERT	No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
L295555	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
L295554	u1413	m94	BERT	I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
L295553	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
L295552	u1413	m94	BERT	Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
L295551	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
L295550	u1413	m94	BERT	I never saw you do anything else.
L295549	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You think I can lose?
L295548	u1413	m94	BERT	How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
L295547	u1416	m94	EDDIE	That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
L295546	u1413	m94	BERT	For me.
L295545	u1416	m94	EDDIE	For who?
L295544	u1413	m94	BERT	Seventy-five per cent.
L295543	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
L295542	u1413	m94	BERT	Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
L295541	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Why?
L295540	u1413	m94	BERT	Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
L295539	u1416	m94	EDDIE	To do what?
L295538	u1413	m94	BERT	Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
L295537	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Thanks for the drink.
L295536	u1413	m94	BERT	Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
L295535	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I told you. I got drunk.
L295534	u1413	m94	BERT	First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
L295533	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What's that supposed to mean?
L295532	u1413	m94	BERT	Eddie, you're a born loser.
L295531	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Whaddya been so far?
L295530	u1413	m94	BERT	Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
L295529	u1416	m94	EDDIE	In that case, you owe me another drink.
L295528	u1413	m94	BERT	See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
L295527	u1416	m94	EDDIE	How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
L295526	u1413	m94	BERT	No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
L295525	u1416	m94	EDDIE	A thousand.
L295524	u1413	m94	BERT	Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
L295523	u1416	m94	EDDIE	So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
L295522	u1413	m94	BERT	That's your problem.
L295521	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
L295520	u1413	m94	BERT	You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
L295519	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Maybe he knows how to drink.
L295518	u1413	m94	BERT	He drank as much whisky as you did.
L295517	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I got drunk.
L295516	u1413	m94	BERT	You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
L295515	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. Sure, sure.
L295514	u1413	m94	BERT	Character.
L295513	u1416	m94	EDDIE	So I got talent. So what beat me?
L295512	u1413	m94	BERT	I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
L295511	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You being cute?
L295510	u1413	m94	BERT	Pool.
L295509	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What is?
L295508	u1413	m94	BERT	Poker's not your game.
L295507	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I lost twenty bucks.
L295506	u1413	m94	BERT	I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
L295505	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah? Why?
L295504	u1413	m94	BERT	Only when I work.
L295503	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Thought you only drank milk.
L295502	u1413	m94	BERT	I'm buyin'.
L295501	u1413	m94	BERT	Two.
L295500	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
L295499	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Deal.
L295498	u1413	m94	BERT	Cut.
L295497	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Make it twenty.
L295492	u1413	m94	BERT	Sit down.
L295491	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Okay?
L295230	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What did he say?
L295229	u1413	m94	BERT	Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
L295213	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
L295212	u1413	m94	BERT	The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
L295211	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hey, mister.
L295149	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
L295148	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
L295147	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
L295146	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You got that wrong, mister. I am.
L295143	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	You well-heeled, partner?
L295142	u1416	m94	EDDIE	He's my partner.
L295139	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	Want some free advice?
L295138	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, that's right.
L295137	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
L295136	u1416	m94	EDDIE	The expensive kind.
L295135	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	What kind of straight pool game you like?
L295134	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
L295133	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	Look, friend, I'm not trying to hustle. I don't never hustle people that walk into poolrooms with leather satchels. Don't try to hustle me.
L295132	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You name it, we shoot it.
L295131	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	What's your game? What do you shoot?
L295130	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Who's he?
L295129	u1414	m94	BIG JOHN	No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
L295128	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Maybe. You want to play?
L295456	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. Just like that.
L295455	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Just like that?
L295454	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
L295453	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
L295452	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, that's what I think.
L295451	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Is that what you think?
L295450	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
L295449	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
L295448	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, to play Fats again.
L295447	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	What for? To play Fats again?
L295446	u1416	m94	EDDIE	C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
L295445	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Aw, Eddie.
L295444	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
L295443	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
L295442	u1416	m94	EDDIE	HOW MUCH?!
L295440	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
L295439	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh yeah? Where?
L295438	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
L295437	u1416	m94	EDDIE	With what?
L295435	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	He thinks I care about the money.  I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye?  You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you.  This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames...  Excuse me...  I'll tell you what -- take her along.
L295434	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I told you you'd get your money back.
L295433	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
L295432	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
L295431	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
L295430	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
L295429	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
L295428	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
L295427	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	I want you to come back on the road with me.
L295426	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Talk to me, Charlie.
L295425	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	"Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, ""This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."""
L295424	u1416	m94	EDDIE	A son.
L295423	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners.  He was like a... like --
L295422	u1416	m94	EDDIE	So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
L295421	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
L295420	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
L295419	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
L295416	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	I asked around.
L295415	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
L295414	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
L295413	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hello, Charlie...  C'mon in...  That's my girl.
L295254	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
L295253	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Is this all we got left?
L295247	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Okay, here...  Be a damn fool.
L295246	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
L295245	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Go to hell.
L295244	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Go on home. Just leave me the money.

L295225	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Get with what?

L295190	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Charlie, I'm gonna take him.

L295115	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
L295114	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
L295113	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
L295112	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	It's quiet.

L295089	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Why?
L295088	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
L295087	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
L295086	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
L295085	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
L295076	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
L295075	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
L295072	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
L295071	u1415	m94	CHARLIE	Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
L295894	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. Sure.
L295893	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	Yeah. You must come again.

L295825	u1418	m94	FINDLEY	I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
L295824	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I thought we came here to play pool.

L295586	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	Okay, friend. You're on.
L295585	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
L295584	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
L295583	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	Okay.
L295582	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Shoot.
L295581	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	Try me.
L295580	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
L295579	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
L295578	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
L295577	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	I guess it's just you and me, huh?
L295576	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Couple of bucks.
L295575	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	How much are you ahead?
L295574	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You're a pretty good player.
L295573	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	You quittin' too?
L295570	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	Okay, friend.
L295569	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
L295568	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
L295567	u1416	m94	EDDIE	How much you playin' for?
L295564	u1421	m94	YOUNG MAN	Hi.
L295563	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hi.
L295883	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
L295882	u1420	m94	SARAH	Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
L295881	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Shut up.
L295880	u1420	m94	SARAH	Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
L295879	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
L295878	u1420	m94	SARAH	Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
L295877	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Go on back to the hotel.
L295816	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm a little tired.
L295815	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, what's the matter?
L295814	u1420	m94	SARAH	If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
L295783	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Just for luck.
L295782	u1420	m94	SARAH	Why?
L295781	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
L295780	u1420	m94	SARAH	He went off someplace.
L295779	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Where's Bert?
L295759	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'll be up later.
L295758	u1420	m94	SARAH	Fifty-seven.
L295702	u1420	m94	SARAH	No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
L295701	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
L295700	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
L295699	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
L295698	u1420	m94	SARAH	What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
L295697	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
L295696	u1420	m94	SARAH	If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
L295695	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
L295694	u1420	m94	SARAH	Why should I?
L295693	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, grow up.
L295692	u1420	m94	SARAH	Leave now.
L295691	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
L295690	u1420	m94	SARAH	No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
L295689	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Don't you want to know where I'm going?
L295687	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Come here. Come on, now.
L295686	u1420	m94	SARAH	No, I want to walk.
L295684	u1420	m94	SARAH	Sure. Let's go home.
L295683	u1416	m94	EDDIE	More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
L295682	u1420	m94	SARAH	A week? A year?
L295681	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, I don't know.
L295680	u1420	m94	SARAH	For how long?
L295679	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
L295678	u1420	m94	SARAH	What do you want to tell me?
L295677	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Nothin'.  Want another drink?
L295676	u1420	m94	SARAH	What is it, Eddie?
L295672	u1416	m94	EDDIE	First time for everything.
L295671	u1420	m94	SARAH	Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
L295670	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, what's so funny?
L295669	u1420	m94	SARAH	I feel pretty.
L295668	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
L295667	u1420	m94	SARAH	Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
L295638	u1420	m94	SARAH	Yes, I'm glad.
L295637	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You glad?
L295636	u1420	m94	SARAH	Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
L295635	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You need the words?
L295634	u1420	m94	SARAH	I love you.
L295633	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
L295632	u1420	m94	SARAH	You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
L295631	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah.  Yeah. It bothers me a lot.  'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
L295630	u1420	m94	SARAH	Does it bother you? What he said?
L295629	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, what else does?
L295628	u1420	m94	SARAH	Is that what makes a winner?
L295627	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, he owns things.
L295626	u1420	m94	SARAH	Is he a winner?
L295625	u1416	m94	EDDIE	He's a gambler.
L295624	u1420	m94	SARAH	What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
L295623	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
L295622	u1420	m94	SARAH	Why did he tell you?
L295621	u1416	m94	EDDIE	He knows. A lot.
L295620	u1420	m94	SARAH	Would he know?
L295619	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
L295618	u1420	m94	SARAH	A loser?
L295617	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
L295615	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What's it so hot in here for?
L295614	u1420	m94	SARAH	No. You?
L295613	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You wanna drink?
L295612	u1420	m94	SARAH	You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
L295608	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
L295607	u1420	m94	SARAH	What happened?
L295606	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Me. It's Eddie.
L295605	u1420	m94	SARAH	Who is it?
L295479	u1420	m94	SARAH	That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
L295478	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
L295477	u1420	m94	SARAH	You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
L295474	u1416	m94	EDDIE	"What's this supposed to mean: ""We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."""
L295473	u1420	m94	SARAH	Give it back to me.
L295472	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What's this supposed to mean?
L295471	u1420	m94	SARAH	Give it to me.
L295470	u1420	m94	SARAH	Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
L295469	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What are you writing?
L295465	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. For a little while.
L295464	u1420	m94	SARAH	You going out?
L295418	u1416	m94	EDDIE	No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
L295417	u1420	m94	SARAH	Do you want me to go?
L295411	u1420	m94	SARAH	From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
L295410	u1416	m94	EDDIE	It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
L295409	u1420	m94	SARAH	No, why should I? It's yours.
L295408	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Haven't you opened it?
L295407	u1420	m94	SARAH	Eddie, what's in that case?
L295406	u1420	m94	SARAH	Oh, it's not bad.
L295405	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I've got something in my bag.
L295404	u1420	m94	SARAH	Oh, cut my finger.
L295403	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Raw.
L295402	u1420	m94	SARAH	Eggs. How do you like them?
L295401	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Don't you ever cook anything?
L295400	u1420	m94	SARAH	The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
L295399	u1416	m94	EDDIE	No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
L295398	u1420	m94	SARAH	When you've got money, you'll pay.
L295397	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What did all this stuff cost you?
L295396	u1420	m94	SARAH	Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
L295395	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I'm hungry.
L295394	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm getting treatments right here.
L295393	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
L295392	u1420	m94	SARAH	When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
L295391	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You got it all in your head?
L295390	u1420	m94	SARAH	Mm hmm.
L295389	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What, are you kidding? See that book?  I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter.  Did you read all them books?
L295388	u1420	m94	SARAH	You want to go with me?
L295387	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
L295386	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Museums... art galleries... concerts.
L295385	u1420	m94	SARAH	Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
L295384	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Thanks.
L295383	u1420	m94	SARAH	"You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, ""Listen, I got a fella."""
L295381	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
L295380	u1420	m94	SARAH	You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
L295379	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Oh, I forgot.
L295378	u1420	m94	SARAH	At school. It's Thursday.
L295377	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Where you been all day?
L295374	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, what do you want to know? And why?
L295373	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm not sure... I don't know.
L295372	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later...  Come here.
L295371	u1420	m94	SARAH	Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
L295370	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Okay. So what's your name today?
L295369	u1420	m94	SARAH	I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
L295368	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You told me.
L295367	u1420	m94	SARAH	How did you know my name was Sarah?
L295366	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What did you say that for, Sarah?
L295365	u1420	m94	SARAH	Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
L295364	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Come here.
L295363	u1420	m94	SARAH	Why?
L295362	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
L295361	u1420	m94	SARAH	What time is it?
L295360	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Give me a drag.
L295359	u1420	m94	SARAH	A day like any other. People come, people go.
L295358	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
L295357	u1420	m94	SARAH	Why did you do that?
L295334	u1416	m94	EDDIE	No. I'll take you home.
L295333	u1420	m94	SARAH	What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
L295332	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Fifth of scotch?
L295331	u1420	m94	SARAH	No.
L295330	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I could always get us a bottle.
L295329	u1420	m94	SARAH	I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
L295328	u1416	m94	EDDIE	I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
L295327	u1420	m94	SARAH	The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
L295326	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Eddie. The name is Eddie.
L295325	u1420	m94	SARAH	No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
L295324	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Hey!
L295323	u1420	m94	SARAH	I drink.
L295322	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What do you do on the other days?
L295321	u1420	m94	SARAH	I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
L295320	u1416	m94	EDDIE	So why go to college?
L295319	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm not.
L295318	u1416	m94	EDDIE	No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
L295317	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
L295316	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You don't look like a college girl.
L295315	u1420	m94	SARAH	I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
L295314	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah? What do you do now?
L295313	u1420	m94	SARAH	I used to be an actress.
L295312	u1416	m94	EDDIE	You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
L295309	u1420	m94	SARAH	Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
L295308	u1416	m94	EDDIE	No, not always.
L295307	u1420	m94	SARAH	Do you always ask so many questions?
L295306	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
L295305	u1420	m94	SARAH	I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
L295304	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Around.
L295303	u1420	m94	SARAH	Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
L295302	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Then why go to the bus station?
L295301	u1420	m94	SARAH	I wasn't waiting for a bus.
L295300	u1416	m94	EDDIE	How come you didn't catch your bus?
L295299	u1420	m94	SARAH	It's the lights. And the scotch.
L295295	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Can I buy you another drink?
L295294	u1420	m94	SARAH	Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
L295293	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
L295292	u1420	m94	SARAH	Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
L295291	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Can I sit down?
L295290	u1420	m94	SARAH	Fair.
L295289	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Have a nice trip?
L295282	u1420	m94	SARAH	Thanks. I will.
L295281	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Have a nice trip.
L295279	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
L295278	u1420	m94	SARAH	That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
L295277	u1420	m94	SARAH	Eight o'clock.
L295276	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yours.
L295275	u1420	m94	SARAH	What bus?
L295274	u1416	m94	EDDIE	What time does the bus leave?
L295273	u1420	m94	SARAH	Fine, thanks.
L295272	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?

L295161	u1416	m94	EDDIE	Yeah. That's right, too.
L295160	u1417	m94	FATS	I hear you've been looking for me.
L295159	u1416	m94	EDDIE	That's right.
L295158	u1417	m94	FATS	California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?

L458974	u2563	m166	JAKE	For what?
L458973	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
L458972	u2563	m166	JAKE	About what?
L458971	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	They wanna talk to you.
L458970	u2563	m166	JAKE	I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
L458969	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	We're from...
L458968	u2563	m166	JAKE	Huh? Whadda ya mean, get up?
L458967	u2558	m166	1ST DEPUTY	Let's go, Jake, wake up!
L458750	u2559	m166	COMO	Ok, champ.
L458749	u2563	m166	JAKE	No, we're all right. Thanks anyway, Tommy.
L458748	u2559	m166	COMO	Just come by to wish you luck.  Need anything?
L458747	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm Ok.
L458746	u2559	m166	COMO	You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
L458745	u2563	m166	JAKE	Tommy, thanks for coming over.
L458744	u2559	m166	COMO	Hey champ!
L458683	u2559	m166	COMO	Make it on his own? Does he know the kind of money involved? I mean the real money. He thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? We're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? A nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? Is he really crazy? Listen, Joey, you understand, you tell him. I don't care how great he is or how colorful. He could beat all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all the Janiros he wants to. He ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. I'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
L458682	u2564	m166	JOEY	Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
L458681	u2559	m166	COMO	He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
L458680	u2564	m166	JOEY	How can he embarrass you?
L458679	u2559	m166	COMO	Look Joey, I wanna tell you something. Your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. And I'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
L458678	u2564	m166	JOEY	Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
L458677	u2559	m166	COMO	What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
L458676	u2564	m166	JOEY	Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
L458675	u2559	m166	COMO	Aside from everything else, your family all right?
L458673	u2559	m166	COMO	All right, you guys, shake hands.
L458672	u2564	m166	JOEY	Yeah, I understand, Tommy.
L458671	u2559	m166	COMO	All right. I don't have to hear any more. I think I understand what happened. I understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. I'm not sayin' Salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. But, Joey, you don't raise your hands. You don't do that kind of thing. This time we forget about it but no more after this. You understand?
L458710	u2563	m166	JAKE	You got any money you want to bet on Billy Fox, you can put it right here...  'cause Jake LaMotta don't go down for nobody.
L458709	u2560	m166	EAGAN	What?
L458708	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
L458707	u2560	m166	EAGAN	I want to believe you, LaMotta.
L458706	u2563	m166	JAKE	Believe what you want.
L458705	u2560	m166	EAGAN	Now the fight's off the books altogether. Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. Some people are saying you're going into the tank.
L458704	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't follow no gamblin' Commissioner. I'm just a fighter.
L458703	u2560	m166	EAGAN	You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
L458702	u2563	m166	JAKE	What who's been sayin'?
L458699	u2560	m166	EAGAN	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
L458698	u2563	m166	JAKE	What's up, Colonel?
L458447	u2561	m166	IRMA	None of your fuckin' business.
L458446	u2563	m166	JAKE	And where you goin'?
L458445	u2561	m166	IRMA	You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
L458444	u2563	m166	JAKE	What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
L458443	u2561	m166	IRMA	Where you going at this hour?
L458361	u2563	m166	JAKE	No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
L458360	u2561	m166	IRMA	Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
L458359	u2561	m166	IRMA	Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
L458358	u2563	m166	JAKE	It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
L458357	u2561	m166	IRMA	It's not done.
L458356	u2563	m166	JAKE	This looks done.
L458948	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
L458947	u2562	m166	J.R.	Where's your wife, Jake?
L458946	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
L458945	u2562	m166	J.R.	I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
L458944	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're a good sport, lady.
L458942	u2562	m166	J.R.	You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
L458941	u2563	m166	JAKE	J.R., glad you could make it.
L458872	u2564	m166	JOEY	Stop it. What're you, crazy?
L458871	u2563	m166	JAKE	Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
L458840	u2564	m166	JOEY	I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. I can't take this shit. Lenore is waitin' for me. I gotta go. You're a definite wacko. You're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.
L458839	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
L458838	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whatsa matter with you?
L458837	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did you ever fuck my wife?
L458836	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whadda ya mean?
L458835	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
L458834	u2564	m166	JOEY	What?
L458833	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did you ever fuck my wife?
L458832	u2564	m166	JOEY	You're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... You wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
L458831	u2563	m166	JAKE	Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
L458830	u2564	m166	JOEY	So what?
L458829	u2563	m166	JAKE	"But you said ""you."""
L458828	u2564	m166	JOEY	I meant, kill everybody. You or me or anybody. You're a big shot. Kill, kill... g'head.
L458827	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do you mean, ""you""?"
L458826	u2564	m166	JOEY	What?
L458825	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do you mean, ""you""?"
L458824	u2564	m166	JOEY	So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
L458823	u2563	m166	JAKE	You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
L458822	u2564	m166	JOEY	"Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin"" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now."
L458821	u2563	m166	JAKE	When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
L458820	u2564	m166	JOEY	What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
L458819	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
L458818	u2564	m166	JOEY	Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
L458817	u2563	m166	JAKE	Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
L458816	u2564	m166	JOEY	I did keep an eye...
L458815	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
L458814	u2564	m166	JOEY	What?
L458813	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
L458812	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whatever you touched, that's good now.
L458810	u2563	m166	JAKE	Well, I heard some things.
L458809	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack, no. I just explained the whole thing to you. It was just between me and Salvy, if it had anything to do with you and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.
L458808	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who did it have anything to do with... Vickie?
L458807	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, I just told you what happened.
L458806	u2563	m166	JAKE	Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
L458805	u2564	m166	JOEY	It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
L458804	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why didn't you tell me about it?
L458803	u2564	m166	JOEY	Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
L458802	u2563	m166	JAKE	You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
L458801	u2564	m166	JOEY	When?
L458800	u2563	m166	JAKE	Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
L458798	u2564	m166	JOEY	I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
L458797	u2563	m166	JAKE	How's that?
L458796	u2563	m166	JAKE	Well, that's what I mean.
L458795	u2564	m166	JOEY	Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
L458794	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? I never even kissed Mama on the mouth.
L458793	u2564	m166	JOEY	What? I just said hello. Since when I can't kiss my sister-in-law?
L458790	u2563	m166	JAKE	Where you been?
L458789	u2564	m166	JOEY	Screw you, Jack.
L458738	u2563	m166	JAKE	What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
L458737	u2564	m166	JOEY	So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
L458736	u2563	m166	JAKE	I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
L458735	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm gonna order up some stuff. Have a steak.
L458731	u2564	m166	JOEY	We did what we had to do. Tommy don't forget. Sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if Tommy don't die.
L458730	u2563	m166	JAKE	Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...
L458729	u2564	m166	JOEY	All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.
L458728	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
L458727	u2564	m166	JOEY	Except fall down like a normal person.
L458726	u2563	m166	JAKE	What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
L458725	u2564	m166	JOEY	See? That's all there was to it.
L458724	u2564	m166	JOEY	G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
L458723	u2563	m166	JAKE	C'mon, Joey.
L458722	u2564	m166	JOEY	Stick out your hands, Jake.
L458695	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, I know.
L458694	u2564	m166	JOEY	I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
L458693	u2563	m166	JAKE	What did Tommy say?
L458692	u2564	m166	JOEY	Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
L458691	u2563	m166	JAKE	I want you to keep an eye on her when I'm not here. Understand?
L458690	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
L458689	u2563	m166	JAKE	When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
L458688	u2564	m166	JOEY	Try talkin' to her. She's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
L458687	u2563	m166	JAKE	What do you mean?
L458686	u2564	m166	JOEY	Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
L458685	u2563	m166	JAKE	I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
L458684	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whatcha doin'?
L458587	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
L458586	u2564	m166	JOEY	Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
L458583	u2564	m166	JOEY	C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
L458582	u2563	m166	JAKE	Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
L458581	u2564	m166	JOEY	Nah, she would never...
L458556	u2564	m166	JOEY	This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
L458555	u2563	m166	JAKE	Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
L458554	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want the title shot or not?
L458553	u2563	m166	JAKE	Say what you're gonna say.
L458552	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want the title shot?
L458551	u2563	m166	JAKE	Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
L458550	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
L458549	u2563	m166	JAKE	I just weighed myself -- I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
L458548	u2563	m166	JAKE	No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
L458547	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want us to wait for you?
L458543	u2563	m166	JAKE	I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to win. I've done a lot of bad things. I dunno...
L458542	u2564	m166	JOEY	You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
L458541	u2563	m166	JAKE	Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
L458540	u2564	m166	JOEY	They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
L458520	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm the only guy ever to beat Sugar Ray, and I still don't have a shot at the title.
L458519	u2564	m166	JOEY	He fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
L458462	u2564	m166	JOEY	Give me a chance. Let me look.
L458461	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do you see her yet?
L458454	u2563	m166	JAKE	How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
L458453	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
L458452	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
L458442	u2564	m166	JOEY	C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
L458441	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
L458440	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there. Dressed up and everything.
L458439	u2563	m166	JAKE	Nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. I'll wait. Not now.
L458438	u2564	m166	JOEY	Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
L458437	u2563	m166	JAKE	You know, like bang her or anything?
L458436	u2564	m166	JOEY	With her? How?
L458435	u2563	m166	JAKE	You wasn't with her?
L458434	u2564	m166	JOEY	Huh?
L458433	u2563	m166	JAKE	You wasn't with her, were you?
L458432	u2564	m166	JOEY	Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
L458431	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, she's nice.
L458430	u2564	m166	JOEY	Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
L458429	u2563	m166	JAKE	What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
L458428	u2564	m166	JOEY	Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
L458427	u2563	m166	JAKE	She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
L458426	u2564	m166	JOEY	How you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... I don't know if she'll be there alone... She'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
L458425	u2563	m166	JAKE	'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
L458424	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I know she'll be there.
L458423	u2563	m166	JAKE	Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
L458422	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
L458421	u2563	m166	JAKE	How do you know? You know her that good?
L458420	u2564	m166	JOEY	You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
L458419	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go 'head.
L458418	u2564	m166	JOEY	Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
L458417	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah --
L458416	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
L458415	u2563	m166	JAKE	Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
L458414	u2564	m166	JOEY	Whadda you care?
L458413	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who's that?
L458409	u2564	m166	JOEY	I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
L458408	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
L458407	u2564	m166	JOEY	What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
L458406	u2563	m166	JAKE	And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
L458403	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
L458402	u2564	m166	JOEY	Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
L458401	u2563	m166	JAKE	Answer me when I talk to you.
L458397	u2563	m166	JAKE	See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
L458396	u2564	m166	JOEY	What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
L458395	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go ahead.
L458394	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack! Enough!
L458393	u2563	m166	JAKE	Harder.  Take the towel off.
L458389	u2563	m166	JAKE	Here's your glove.
L458388	u2564	m166	JOEY	Jack, I got no gloves.
L458387	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
L458386	u2564	m166	JOEY	C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
L458385	u2563	m166	JAKE	You heard me, I said hit me.
L458384	u2564	m166	JOEY	You want me to do what?
L458383	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hit me in the face.
L458382	u2564	m166	JOEY	Sure. What is it?
L458381	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah. Do me a favor.
L458380	u2564	m166	JOEY	You know?
L458379	u2563	m166	JAKE	I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
L458378	u2564	m166	JOEY	That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
L458376	u2564	m166	JOEY	What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
L458375	u2563	m166	JAKE	I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
L458374	u2564	m166	JOEY	Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
L458373	u2563	m166	JAKE	Nothing...
L458372	u2564	m166	JOEY	What's wrong?
L458937	u2565	m166	REPORTER	What do you think of Jake's retirement, Mrs. LaMotta?
L458936	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ain't she beautiful? Coulda been Mrs. America if I didn't pull her outa the contest. Didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
L458935	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why should I be bitter? Boxing's been good to me. I got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. Vickie.
L458934	u2565	m166	REPORTER	You sound bitter.
L458933	u2563	m166	JAKE	It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
L458932	u2565	m166	REPORTER	Does that mean...
L458931	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
L458522	u2563	m166	JAKE	I tell you what. You hit me here.  Sugar Ray hits me here.  I can't tell the difference. I just fight.
L458521	u2565	m166	REPORTER	You just fought Sugar Ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... Are you afraid Sugar Ray might beat you this time?
L458518	u2563	m166	JAKE	You guys know more about that than I do. I just fight...
L458517	u2565	m166	REPORTER	Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
L458516	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
L458513	u2563	m166	JAKE	Maybe it wasn't you, but you know what I'm talkin' about.
L458512	u2565	m166	REPORTER	Jake, did I ever make you look bad before?
L458511	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm tellin' you now, when I read this, it better not make me look bad.
L458925	u2568	m166	TONY	Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
L458924	u2563	m166	JAKE	He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
L458893	u2563	m166	JAKE	Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
L458892	u2568	m166	TONY	I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
L458891	u2563	m166	JAKE	Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
L458890	u2568	m166	TONY	Three more, I figure.
L458889	u2563	m166	JAKE	How many pounds I gotta lose?
L458888	u2568	m166	TONY	Yeah. At night.
L458887	u2563	m166	JAKE	At night?
L458886	u2568	m166	TONY	Nine o'clock.
L458885	u2563	m166	JAKE	What time is it?
L458884	u2568	m166	TONY	It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.
L458717	u2563	m166	JAKE	Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
L458716	u2568	m166	TONY	Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!
L458996	u2563	m166	JAKE	What friends?
L458995	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Can't you get the money from your friends?
L458994	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't make no difference no more.
L458993	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
L458992	u2563	m166	JAKE	"Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? ""LaMotta on Vice Rap."" Everybody likes a shot at the Champ."
L458991	u2569	m166	VICKIE	But they don't have a case against you.
L458990	u2563	m166	JAKE	I need ten thousand dollars. My lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
L458989	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What are you doing?
L458988	u2569	m166	VICKIE	All right, just don't make any noise.
L458987	u2563	m166	JAKE	I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
L458986	u2569	m166	VICKIE	The kids are sleeping.
L458984	u2563	m166	JAKE	No. Open the door.
L458983	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Are you drunk?
L458982	u2563	m166	JAKE	Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
L458965	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
L458964	u2563	m166	JAKE	Aw, c'mon, Vick --
L458963	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
L458962	u2563	m166	JAKE	Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
L458961	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
L458960	u2563	m166	JAKE	Open the door, Vickie.
L458959	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
L458958	u2563	m166	JAKE	Sure, what else is new?
L458957	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm leaving you Jake.
L458956	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'm sorry. I had to work late last night. Slept at the club.
L458912	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
L458911	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
L458910	u2563	m166	JAKE	I dunno.
L458909	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Why don't you just call him?
L458908	u2563	m166	JAKE	I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.
L458904	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I don't know.
L458903	u2563	m166	JAKE	Then what?
L458902	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No, not that.
L458901	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, ""Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?"" Is that what I say?"
L458900	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Why don't you just call him up?
L458899	u2563	m166	JAKE	OK. Talk.
L458898	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
L458897	u2563	m166	JAKE	What?
L458896	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake --
L458895	u2563	m166	JAKE	I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
L458894	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
L458883	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah --
L458882	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
L458878	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  You're rotten.  Rotten.  Rotten.  You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
L458877	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're the fuckin' animal! You ran around with every guy I knew while I was breakin' my ass for you.
L458876	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
L458875	u2563	m166	JAKE	Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
L458874	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
L458868	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Yeah, I sucked his cock.
L458867	u2563	m166	JAKE	You did?
L458866	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
L458863	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're a fuckin' liar.
L458862	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
L458861	u2563	m166	JAKE	Come out of there! Did you fuck Salvy?  Answer me. Open this fuckin' door, you fuckin' cunt!  Who've you been fuckin'?
L458860	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there.  Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong. 
L458859	u2563	m166	JAKE	With Salvy, eh?
L458858	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
L458857	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
L458856	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, no --
L458855	u2563	m166	JAKE	What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
L458854	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I am answering...
L458853	u2563	m166	JAKE	Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
L458852	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What're you talking about?
L458851	u2563	m166	JAKE	Did you ever go to the Copa when I was away?
L458850	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
L458849	u2563	m166	JAKE	What was it about?
L458848	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Father of the Bride.
L458847	u2563	m166	JAKE	What'd you see?
L458846	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I went to the movies.
L458845	u2563	m166	JAKE	What'd you see?
L458844	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I got bored so I went to the movies.
L458843	u2563	m166	JAKE	I called. You weren't there.
L458842	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I took the kids to my sister's.
L458841	u2563	m166	JAKE	Where you been all day?
L458792	u2563	m166	JAKE	What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
L458791	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I went out.
L458788	u2563	m166	JAKE	Tryin' to get this fuckin' TV to work. Paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. And Mr. Wizard here ain't no help.
L458787	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What's the matter with you?
L458763	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake...
L458762	u2563	m166	JAKE	Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
L458761	u2569	m166	VICKIE	But Jake... I didn't say anything...
L458759	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You're hurting my arm.
L458758	u2563	m166	JAKE	You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
L458757	u2569	m166	VICKIE	All I did...
L458756	u2563	m166	JAKE	You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
L458755	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What did I do?
L458754	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
L458617	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
L458616	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Positive.
L458615	u2563	m166	JAKE	You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
L458614	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I never noticed his face.
L458613	u2563	m166	JAKE	That he's got a pretty face.
L458612	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What did I say?
L458611	u2563	m166	JAKE	Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
L458610	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Nobody. I love you, remember?
L458609	u2563	m166	JAKE	Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
L458608	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Yeah, what?
L458607	u2563	m166	JAKE	Huh?
L458606	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Yeah.
L458605	u2563	m166	JAKE	You asleep?
L458604	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What?
L458603	u2563	m166	JAKE	Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
L458580	u2563	m166	JAKE	Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
L458579	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
L458578	u2563	m166	JAKE	In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
L458577	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No, I'm not.
L458576	u2563	m166	JAKE	You're not interested in him?
L458575	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm not interested in him.
L458574	u2563	m166	JAKE	"Don't tell me ""No."" I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?"
L458573	u2569	m166	VICKIE	No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
L458572	u2563	m166	JAKE	What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?
L458564	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who asked you?
L458563	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I was just...
L458562	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who asked you?
L458561	u2569	m166	VICKIE	But, Jake, I was just...
L458560	u2563	m166	JAKE	Who asked you?
L458559	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
L458558	u2563	m166	JAKE	"What do you mean, ""good looking?"""
L458557	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
L458538	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Oh, Jake.
L458537	u2563	m166	JAKE	Now, touch me...  ...here.
L458536	u2563	m166	JAKE	Now take your panties off.
L458535	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I like the gym smell.
L458534	u2563	m166	JAKE	Go 'head. Do it.
L458533	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
L458532	u2563	m166	JAKE	Now take the rest off.
L458531	u2563	m166	JAKE	Do what I say.
L458530	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake...
L458529	u2563	m166	JAKE	Take off my pants.
L458528	u2563	m166	JAKE	Come here.
L458527	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
L458526	u2563	m166	JAKE	If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
L458525	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You said never to touch you before a fight.
L458524	u2563	m166	JAKE	Come over here.
L458523	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Are you sure we should be doing this?
L458505	u2563	m166	JAKE	It's OK.
L458504	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake...
L458503	u2563	m166	JAKE	That's all right. He don't mind.
L458502	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
L458492	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What does that mean?
L458491	u2563	m166	JAKE	No.
L458490	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Can you see it?
L458488	u2563	m166	JAKE	Can you see it?
L458487	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I can't find my ball.
L458486	u2563	m166	JAKE	Just give it a nice little tap.
L458485	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Should I hit it?
L458484	u2563	m166	JAKE	Just keep your eye on the ball.
L458483	u2569	m166	VICKIE	It feels real good.
L458482	u2563	m166	JAKE	That's it. Just grip up a little tighter. That's it. You're gonna be real good at this. How does that feel?
L458481	u2563	m166	JAKE	You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
L458480	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
L458477	u2563	m166	JAKE	Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
L458476	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
L458475	u2563	m166	JAKE	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
L458474	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You don't talk very much.
L458471	u2563	m166	JAKE	Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
L458470	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
L458469	u2563	m166	JAKE	You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
L458468	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I just wanted to say hello.
L458467	u2563	m166	JAKE	Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
L458602	u2563	m166	JAKE	I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
L458601	u2567	m166	TOMMY	All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
L458600	u2563	m166	JAKE	Yeah, the weight's Ok.
L458599	u2567	m166	TOMMY	How's the weight? Ok?
L458597	u2567	m166	TOMMY	This Janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
L458596	u2563	m166	JAKE	He should.
L458595	u2567	m166	TOMMY	Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
L458594	u2563	m166	JAKE	Never felt better.
L458593	u2567	m166	TOMMY	How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
L458592	u2563	m166	JAKE	C'mon, Tommy --
L458591	u2567	m166	TOMMY	"Fuckin' kid! You're the best fuckin' fighter around. Loved what you did to Satterfield. Them ""moulan yans"" -- forget about it. They're all afraid to fight you."
L458590	u2567	m166	TOMMY	Jake, sit down for a minute.
L458589	u2563	m166	JAKE	Hi, Tommy. How are you?
L458667	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'll suck your eyes out! I'll fuckin' take the two of you.
L458666	u2566	m166	SALVY	Hey Joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
L458662	u2566	m166	SALVY	Hey Joey, I'm here with Patsy and Vera and Sandy. And Vickie just happened to come along. We're just trying to have a good time. What do you want from me? So, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
L458661	u2564	m166	JOEY	What do you think, I'm blind? My brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
L458660	u2566	m166	SALVY	Excuse me for living.
L458659	u2564	m166	JOEY	Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
L458658	u2566	m166	SALVY	Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
L458657	u2564	m166	JOEY	I said, let's go.
L458368	u2564	m166	JOEY	Right, the gym.
L458367	u2566	m166	SALVY	Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
L458366	u2564	m166	JOEY	All right, I'll try. See you later.
L458365	u2566	m166	SALVY	Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
L458364	u2566	m166	SALVY	Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
L458363	u2564	m166	JOEY	I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
L458350	u2566	m166	SALVY	"Get lost.  Hey kids, ""A cop is a rat."" Remember that, ""A rat."""
L458349	u2564	m166	JOEY	Hey, leave the kids alone.
L458348	u2566	m166	SALVY	He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
L458347	u2564	m166	JOEY	What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
L458346	u2566	m166	SALVY	Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
L458345	u2564	m166	JOEY	Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
L458655	u2569	m166	VICKIE	And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
L458654	u2564	m166	JOEY	And you're drinking with them right now.
L458653	u2569	m166	VICKIE	That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
L458652	u2564	m166	JOEY	Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
L458651	u2569	m166	VICKIE	You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
L458650	u2564	m166	JOEY	I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
L458649	u2569	m166	VICKIE	Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
L458648	u2564	m166	JOEY	It don't look right.
L458647	u2569	m166	VICKIE	I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
L458646	u2564	m166	JOEY	No, you're his wife.
L458645	u2569	m166	VICKIE	What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
L458644	u2564	m166	JOEY	What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
L117556	u4325	m288	NUKE	Don't worry.
L117555	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
L117554	u4325	m288	NUKE	I think I'm ready for the Show.
L117553	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Neither will I.
L117552	u4325	m288	NUKE	I won't be needing these anymore.
L117551	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Well I guess this is it.
L117480	u4325	m288	NUKE	How can I possibly thank you?
L117479	u4315	m288	ANNIE	That's great!
L117478	u4325	m288	NUKE	I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
L117474	u4325	m288	NUKE	Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
L117473	u4315	m288	ANNIE	It's Skip, for you.
L117470	u4325	m288	NUKE	Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
L117469	u4315	m288	ANNIE	--but you're father's in there!
L117468	u4325	m288	NUKE	Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
L117467	u4315	m288	ANNIE	So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
L117466	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
L117465	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You don't have to...
L117464	u4325	m288	NUKE	I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
L117456	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh--won't YOU come in?
L117455	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'd like you to meet my father.
L117454	u4315	m288	ANNIE	it's okay..
L117453	u4325	m288	NUKE	We lost.
L117347	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'll be back when we lose.
L117346	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He did?
L117345	u4325	m288	NUKE	He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
L117344	u4315	m288	ANNIE	What'd he say?
L117343	u4325	m288	NUKE	I did.
L117342	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
L117341	u4325	m288	NUKE	You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
L117340	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
L117339	u4325	m288	NUKE	I think you're real cute.
L117338	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
L117337	u4325	m288	NUKE	I knew it--you're seducing me!
L117336	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm trying to play with your body!
L117335	u4325	m288	NUKE	No!  You're playing with my mind!
L117330	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
L117329	u4325	m288	NUKE	He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
L117328	u4315	m288	ANNIE	What a nasty thing to say.
L117327	u4325	m288	NUKE	Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle.  He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
L117326	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Yes I do...
L117325	u4325	m288	NUKE	"Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a ""V"" shape?--"
L117324	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
L117323	u4325	m288	NUKE	Fundamentals?
L117322	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
L117321	u4325	m288	NUKE	I know what it is.
L117320	u4315	m288	ANNIE	That's my leg.
L117318	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
L117317	u4325	m288	NUKE	You can't seduce me.
L117316	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'll tuck you in.
L117315	u4325	m288	NUKE	No, that's okay.  All I need's a little nap.
L117314	u4315	m288	ANNIE	How 'bout a back rub?
L117313	u4325	m288	NUKE	No, no, it was great.
L117312	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
L117283	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh--"
L117282	u4325	m288	NUKE	No.
L117281	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Get over here.
L117280	u4325	m288	NUKE	Just till I lose.
L117279	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Nuke?!
L117278	u4325	m288	NUKE	You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
L117277	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
L117276	u4325	m288	NUKE	Not that.  I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy.  Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
L117275	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
L117274	u4325	m288	NUKE	Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
L117273	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm yours.
L117220	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
L117219	u4325	m288	NUKE	Death is like spring training?
L117218	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
L117217	u4325	m288	NUKE	God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
L117214	u4315	m288	ANNIE	It's all the same thing.
L117213	u4325	m288	NUKE	I can't keep up with you.  First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
L117210	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
L117209	u4325	m288	NUKE	How ya like that?
L117208	u4325	m288	NUKE	Gimme the God damn ball!
L117207	u4315	m288	ANNIE	A little better.
L117206	u4325	m288	NUKE	How was that?
L117205	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
L117204	u4325	m288	NUKE	If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
L117203	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
L117202	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
L117201	u4325	m288	NUKE	Switch nostrils?
L117200	u4315	m288	ANNIE	The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
L117199	u4325	m288	NUKE	"I'm really beat.  I need some serious ""z's""--"
L117198	u4315	m288	ANNIE	The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
L117197	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"There are two important psychic conduits called the ""pingala"" and the ""ida"".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril."
L117196	u4325	m288	NUKE	My right nostril?
L117195	u4315	m288	ANNIE	The right nostril.  Good.
L117194	u4325	m288	NUKE	Which nostril am I breathing through?
L117193	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
L117192	u4325	m288	NUKE	This in ridiculous.  I'm a pro.
L117189	u4325	m288	NUKE	Catch?
L117188	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
L117187	u4325	m288	NUKE	Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
L117186	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"What is this ""I, I, I"" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?"
L117185	u4325	m288	NUKE	God I'm tired.  What a trip I was lousy.  I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  I--
L117083	u4315	m288	ANNIE	They did when they were in the Carolina League.
L117082	u4325	m288	NUKE	Big League pitchers don't use these.
L117081	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
L117080	u4325	m288	NUKE	Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
L117079	u4315	m288	ANNIE	They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
L117078	u4325	m288	NUKE	What?
L117077	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
L117002	u4315	m288	ANNIE	There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
L117001	u4325	m288	NUKE	God, I never thought of that.
L117000	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
L116999	u4325	m288	NUKE	I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
L116998	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You can learn to like it.
L116997	u4325	m288	NUKE	Mmm, hmmm.  You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off.  When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life.  He likes baseball more than I do...
L116996	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You see how nice things are when we go slow?
L116995	u4325	m288	NUKE	Yeah maybe you're right.
L116994	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
L116993	u4325	m288	NUKE	"You said ""Crash""."
L116992	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
L116991	u4325	m288	NUKE	"You said ""Crash""."
L116990	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"I didn't say ""Crash"".  I said Nuke."
L116989	u4325	m288	NUKE	"You mean Nuke.  You said ""Crash""."
L117424	u4315	m288	ANNIE	We all deserve to wear white.
L117423	u4324	m288	MILLIE	Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
L117422	u4315	m288	ANNIE	No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
L117421	u4324	m288	MILLIE	You should be at the game.
L117395	u4324	m288	MILLIE	He's a virgin.
L117394	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
L116790	u4324	m288	MILLIE	Well, he fucks like he pitches. Sorta all over the place
L116789	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
L116771	u4315	m288	ANNIE	That's better.  Got the radar ready?
L116770	u4324	m288	MILLIE	I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions.
L116769	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"You didn't get ""lured"".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--""I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions""."
L116768	u4324	m288	MILLIE	I got lured.
L116767	u4315	m288	ANNIE	--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
L117605	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I can do that, too.
L117604	u4317	m288	CRASH	I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics...  I don't wanta think about nothing...  I just wanta be.
L117603	u4315	m288	ANNIE	What?
L117602	u4317	m288	CRASH	Annie---
L117601	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-""non-time kind of time"" to it..."
L117600	u4317	m288	CRASH	You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
L117599	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
L117598	u4317	m288	CRASH	Yeah...you a witch?
L117597	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
L117596	u4317	m288	CRASH	There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
L117595	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
L117594	u4317	m288	CRASH	I quit.  Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
L117593	u4315	m288	ANNIE	What happened?
L117579	u4315	m288	ANNIE	It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
L117578	u4317	m288	CRASH	How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
L117577	u4315	m288	ANNIE	...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
L117575	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I heard already.
L117574	u4317	m288	CRASH	I got released.
L117390	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"Whatta you mean ""why not""?  Are you gonna play forever?!"
L117389	u4317	m288	CRASH	Why not?
L117388	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
L117387	u4317	m288	CRASH	Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
L117386	u4315	m288	ANNIE	No.
L117385	u4317	m288	CRASH	It's possible.
L117384	u4315	m288	ANNIE	It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
L117383	u4317	m288	CRASH	I don't know if I'd go that far.
L117382	u4315	m288	ANNIE	If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
L117381	u4317	m288	CRASH	What's so great about baseball?
L117380	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
L117379	u4317	m288	CRASH	Who?
L117378	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
L117375	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
L117374	u4317	m288	CRASH	Why baseball?
L117372	u4317	m288	CRASH	You okay?
L117371	u4315	m288	ANNIE	God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
L117370	u4317	m288	CRASH	Annie, I think you should leave.
L117369	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I said when I think about you, I get wet.
L117368	u4317	m288	CRASH	--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
L117367	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm ready for a complicated man.
L117366	u4317	m288	CRASH	"I thought you wanted an ""uncomplicated"" boy?"
L117365	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
L117364	u4317	m288	CRASH	I doubt that.
L117363	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
L117362	u4317	m288	CRASH	And now you wanta teach me?
L117361	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
L117360	u4317	m288	CRASH	Who are you?  Do you have a job?
L117359	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I want you desperately!
L117358	u4317	m288	CRASH	And he's right!  A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often.  You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are!  And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
L117357	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He won't make love to me anymore.
L117356	u4317	m288	CRASH	"I think of you and the ""boy"" all the time."
L117355	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I want to be had.
L117354	u4317	m288	CRASH	You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you.  I had to have you!
L117353	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Don't you think I'm pretty?
L117352	u4317	m288	CRASH	Aren't we all?
L117351	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He' s confused--
L117350	u4317	m288	CRASH	Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
L117349	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Crash...I want you.
L116979	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
L116978	u4317	m288	CRASH	A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
L116977	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You got me all confused.
L116976	u4317	m288	CRASH	Well, Annie, your place or mine?
L116973	u4317	m288	CRASH	Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around--  Great deal.  You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing-  So what do you really want?  You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic?  Or do you want a guy?
L116972	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
L116971	u4317	m288	CRASH	Your place or mine?
L116970	u4317	m288	CRASH	Let me.
L116969	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Damn.
L116968	u4317	m288	CRASH	No.  Please.
L116967	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
L116966	u4317	m288	CRASH	247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
L116965	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
L116964	u4317	m288	CRASH	Don't tell anybody.
L116963	u4315	m288	ANNIE	But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
L116962	u4317	m288	CRASH	You're pulling your hips out.
L116961	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Damn.
L116960	u4317	m288	CRASH	That's my job too.
L116959	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not ""dim"".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him ""life-wisdom"" and help him make it to the major leagues."
L116958	u4317	m288	CRASH	What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
L116957	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
L116956	u4317	m288	CRASH	So...Wanta make love?
L116955	u4315	m288	ANNIE	But you were pulling your hips last night.
L116954	u4317	m288	CRASH	When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
L116953	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
L116952	u4317	m288	CRASH	Yep.
L116951	u4315	m288	ANNIE	See my hips?
L116895	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I'm not interested yet.
L116894	u4317	m288	CRASH	I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
L116893	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
L116891	u4317	m288	CRASH	G'night.
L116890	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh my...  Don't leave...
L116889	u4317	m288	CRASH	"I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap.  I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the ""sweet spot"", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days."
L116888	u4315	m288	ANNIE	What do you believe in?
L116887	u4317	m288	CRASH	After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
L116884	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
L116883	u4317	m288	CRASH	Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
L116882	u4315	m288	ANNIE	These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
L116853	u4317	m288	CRASH	I'll learn.  C'mon--
L116852	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Crash, I didn't think you--
L116851	u4317	m288	CRASH	She's dancing with me.
L116843	u4315	m288	ANNIE	I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
L116842	u4317	m288	CRASH	I don't dance.
L116841	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
L116840	u4317	m288	CRASH	I'm Crash Davis.
L117269	u4320	m288	JACKSON	He'll learn.
L117268	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
L117243	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He looks wonderful, Jackson...
L117242	u4320	m288	JACKSON	Ninety-three miles an hour.
L117191	u4315	m288	ANNIE	That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
L117190	u4320	m288	JACKSON	Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
L117044	u4320	m288	JACKSON	Ninety-five miles an hour...
L117043	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh dear....easy honey...
L116788	u4315	m288	ANNIE	It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
L116787	u4320	m288	JACKSON	What's it say?
L116786	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
L116777	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He looks great, just great!
L116776	u4320	m288	JACKSON	Ninety-five miles an hour.
L116760	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
L116759	u4320	m288	JACKSON	Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
L116758	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
L117484	u4315	m288	ANNIE	She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
L117483	u4326	m288	NUKE'S FATHER	God bless you.
L117477	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh let's not...
L117476	u4326	m288	NUKE'S FATHER	Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this--
L117462	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Praise the Lord, eh?
L117461	u4326	m288	NUKE'S FATHER	We were worried that Ebby might get involved with the wrong crowd in professional baseball--we're so pleased, he met a Christian woman.
L117460	u4315	m288	ANNIE	He's a good student.
L117458	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
L117457	u4326	m288	NUKE'S FATHER	Ebby's told me a lot about you.
L116916	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"Shh, shh...  ""They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"""
L116915	u4318	m288	EBBY	We gonna fuck or what?
L116914	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"Good--then listen.  ""I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"""
L116913	u4318	m288	EBBY	Never heard of 'em.
L116912	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
L116911	u4318	m288	EBBY	Who's he play for?
L116910	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
L116907	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
L116906	u4318	m288	EBBY	The socks?  It's cold in here.
L116905	u4315	m288	ANNIE	No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
L116903	u4315	m288	ANNIE	When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
L116902	u4318	m288	EBBY	Jesus, what kinda broad are you?
L116901	u4315	m288	ANNIE	No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
L116899	u4318	m288	EBBY	Well shit, then, let's fuck.
L116898	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"No ballplayer ever said ""no"" to a date with me."
L116886	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
L116885	u4318	m288	EBBY	Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?
L116881	u4315	m288	ANNIE	Oh both of you, of course...
L116880	u4318	m288	EBBY	Which one of us?
L116879	u4315	m288	ANNIE	"Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being ""re-channeled"" but I believe in ""re-channeling"" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?"
L116850	u4318	m288	EBBY	That's what I been telling everybody!  Wanta dance?
L116849	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You need a nickname.
L116848	u4318	m288	EBBY	Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
L116847	u4315	m288	ANNIE	You got a live arm there.
L116846	u4318	m288	EBBY	Thanks for the note--you're right, I wasn't bending my back.
L117019	u4316	m288	BOBBY	C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
L117018	u4322	m288	JOSE	No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
L117017	u4316	m288	BOBBY	I'm 0 for 16!  Gimme some of that shit.

L117014	u4322	m288	JOSE	Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
L117013	u4316	m288	BOBBY	You a God damn witch?
L117012	u4322	m288	JOSE	Chicken bone cross take the curse off this bat and bring me hits.

L117445	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	You're outta here!
L117444	u4317	m288	CRASH	You're a cocksucker!
L117443	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!

L117439	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
L117438	u4317	m288	CRASH	You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
L117437	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	You're close, Crash, you want me to run you?  I'll run you!
L117436	u4317	m288	CRASH	You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
L117435	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	I didn't spit on you!
L117434	u4317	m288	CRASH	You spit on me!
L117433	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	You missed the tag!
L117432	u4317	m288	CRASH	No!  I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
L117431	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	Did you call me a cocksucker?
L117430	u4317	m288	CRASH	It was a cocksucking call!
L117429	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	Don't bump me.
L117428	u4317	m288	CRASH	God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
L117427	u4330	m288	UMPIRE	You missed him!
L117426	u4317	m288	CRASH	I got him on the knee!
L117550	u4325	m288	NUKE	You too...Meat.
L117549	u4317	m288	CRASH	Nuke--  Good luck.
L117548	u4325	m288	NUKE	Yeah, thanks for everything.
L117547	u4317	m288	CRASH	It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
L117546	u4325	m288	NUKE	Maybe you do.  Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
L117545	u4317	m288	CRASH	I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
L117544	u4325	m288	NUKE	Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya...  She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
L117543	u4325	m288	NUKE	I know.  I just like to see you get all worked up.
L117542	u4317	m288	CRASH	No.  Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
L117541	u4325	m288	NUKE	Fear and ignorance.
L117540	u4317	m288	CRASH	You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
L117539	u4325	m288	NUKE	No.
L117538	u4317	m288	CRASH	I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
L117537	u4325	m288	NUKE	Forget it.
L117536	u4317	m288	CRASH	Sorry about last night.
L117534	u4317	m288	CRASH	If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand.  ya might get injured.  That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
L117533	u4325	m288	NUKE	What?
L117532	u4317	m288	CRASH	Good.  Good.  That's terrific...
L117531	u4325	m288	NUKE	My right.
L117530	u4317	m288	CRASH	Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
L117527	u4317	m288	CRASH	You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
L117526	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'll take you back to the hotel.
L117524	u4317	m288	CRASH	Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
L117523	u4325	m288	NUKE	No.
L117522	u4317	m288	CRASH	Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
L117521	u4325	m288	NUKE	You're a great catcher.
L117520	u4317	m288	CRASH	Why are you a fuck?  'Cause you got talent.  I got brains.  But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year.  All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
L117519	u4325	m288	NUKE	Why am I a fuck?
L117518	u4317	m288	CRASH	You fuck!
L117517	u4325	m288	NUKE	C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
L117516	u4317	m288	CRASH	God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
L117515	u4325	m288	NUKE	I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
L117514	u4317	m288	CRASH	C ' mon!
L117513	u4325	m288	NUKE	Settle what?
L117508	u4317	m288	CRASH	Let go of me!
L117507	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'm trying to thank you.
L117506	u4317	m288	CRASH	Then go.
L117505	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'm going to the Show.
L117504	u4317	m288	CRASH	Shut up.  I'm playing.  Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ...  But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
L117503	u4325	m288	NUKE	Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
L117409	u4325	m288	NUKE	Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
L117408	u4317	m288	CRASH	Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
L117403	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'm nervous--my old man's here.
L117402	u4317	m288	CRASH	What's wrong?
L117306	u4317	m288	CRASH	You outta your mind?  If you give in now you might start losing.  Never fuck with a winning streak.
L117305	u4325	m288	NUKE	She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down.  What'ya think?
L117304	u4317	m288	CRASH	Yep.  So how's Annie?
L117303	u4325	m288	NUKE	...Good Lord willing, things'll work out.
L117302	u4317	m288	CRASH	"Write, write--""I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."""
L117301	u4325	m288	NUKE	Jesus.
L117300	u4317	m288	CRASH	"Of course.  That's the point.  ""I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."""
L117299	u4325	m288	NUKE	Boring.
L117298	u4317	m288	CRASH	"Write this down.  ""We gotta play 'em one day at a time."""
L117297	u4317	m288	CRASH	Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
L117296	u4325	m288	NUKE	What do I gotta do?
L117295	u4317	m288	CRASH	It's time you started working on your interviews.
L117294	u4325	m288	NUKE	I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
L117272	u4317	m288	CRASH	Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
L117271	u4325	m288	NUKE	You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
L117261	u4325	m288	NUKE	You're the boss.
L117260	u4317	m288	CRASH	It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
L117259	u4325	m288	NUKE	Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
L117258	u4317	m288	CRASH	I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
L117257	u4325	m288	NUKE	Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
L117252	u4317	m288	CRASH	The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
L117251	u4325	m288	NUKE	Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
L117250	u4317	m288	CRASH	Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
L117249	u4325	m288	NUKE	I was great, eh?
L117223	u4317	m288	CRASH	Annie's a smart lady.
L117222	u4325	m288	NUKE	Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers.  She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
L117184	u4317	m288	CRASH	I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
L117183	u4325	m288	NUKE	I was playing naked.
L117180	u4317	m288	CRASH	If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
L117179	u4325	m288	NUKE	What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
L117178	u4317	m288	CRASH	What?
L117177	u4325	m288	NUKE	Can I ask you something?
L117161	u4325	m288	NUKE	God--what a Big League move.
L117160	u4317	m288	CRASH	Party without me.
L117139	u4317	m288	CRASH	I won't have to.
L117138	u4325	m288	NUKE	If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
L117137	u4317	m288	CRASH	Go for it.
L117136	u4325	m288	NUKE	You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
L117135	u4317	m288	CRASH	I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
L117134	u4325	m288	NUKE	You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
L117133	u4317	m288	CRASH	By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
L117132	u4325	m288	NUKE	Naw?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
L117131	u4317	m288	CRASH	Naw...
L117130	u4325	m288	NUKE	This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
L117105	u4325	m288	NUKE	"God damn it I'm sick of you calling me ""Meat""!  You wanta step outside!"
L117104	u4317	m288	CRASH	You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
L117100	u4317	m288	CRASH	Yep.
L117099	u4325	m288	NUKE	You been in the Majors?
L117098	u4317	m288	CRASH	You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
L117097	u4325	m288	NUKE	I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
L117096	u4317	m288	CRASH	You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
L117095	u4317	m288	CRASH	A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
L117094	u4325	m288	NUKE	What do I got?
L117093	u4317	m288	CRASH	'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
L117092	u4325	m288	NUKE	How come you don't like me?
L117089	u4317	m288	CRASH	Gimme that.
L117088	u4325	m288	NUKE	Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
L117040	u4317	m288	CRASH	I told him.
L117039	u4325	m288	NUKE	How?
L117038	u4317	m288	CRASH	He did know.
L117037	u4325	m288	NUKE	I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
L117036	u4317	m288	CRASH	An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.  Having fun yet?
L117035	u4325	m288	NUKE	Well, I held it like an egg.
L117034	u4317	m288	CRASH	Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
L117032	u4325	m288	NUKE	"Why's he always call me ""Meat""? I'm the guy driving a Porsche."
L117031	u4317	m288	CRASH	Fastball.
L117030	u4317	m288	CRASH	Awright, meat, give him your heat.
L117029	u4325	m288	NUKE	But he ain't seen my heat--
L117028	u4317	m288	CRASH	To announce your fucking presence with authority?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
L117027	u4325	m288	NUKE	I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
L117026	u4317	m288	CRASH	Why you shaking me off?
L117025	u4317	m288	CRASH	Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
L117024	u4325	m288	NUKE	Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
L117008	u4317	m288	CRASH	Don't think.
L117007	u4325	m288	NUKE	I thought I was--
L117006	u4317	m288	CRASH	Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
L116983	u4317	m288	CRASH	"Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh."
L116982	u4325	m288	NUKE	Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
L117568	u4328	m288	SKIP	Crash, shut the door.

L117052	u4328	m288	SKIP	What're you thinking about out here, Nuke?
L117051	u4317	m288	CRASH	I don't know.  I haven't caught anything yet.
L116818	u4328	m288	SKIP	You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
L116817	u4317	m288	CRASH	And where can I go?
L116816	u4328	m288	SKIP	We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.
L116809	u4328	m288	SKIP	'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
L116808	u4317	m288	CRASH	"I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in ""A"" ball?"
L116805	u4317	m288	CRASH	The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
L116804	u4328	m288	SKIP	Crash Davis?

L116875	u4318	m288	EBBY	We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
L116870	u4317	m288	CRASH	C'mon, Meat.  You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh.  C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
L116869	u4318	m288	EBBY	No way.
L116868	u4317	m288	CRASH	Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
L116867	u4318	m288	EBBY	Don't try me.
L116866	u4317	m288	CRASH	From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
L116865	u4318	m288	EBBY	I'd kill ya.

L117560	u4319	m288	FATHER	We'll be praying for you.
L117559	u4325	m288	NUKE	No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
L117558	u4319	m288	FATHER	I was thinking I could fly up and spend a week in the Big Leagues with you--help you get comfortable.

L230237	u5455	m363	NICKY	That's where I peed.
L230236	u5446	m363	DRIVER	Under the Manhattan Bridge.
L230233	u5455	m363	NICKY	I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
L230232	u5446	m363	DRIVER	I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
L230231	u5455	m363	NICKY	I never left the garage without my Windex.
L230018	u5455	m363	NICKY	Do not inhale.
L230017	u5446	m363	DRIVER	Contaminated substance. Very dangerous. Shooting mud.
L230016	u5455	m363	NICKY	We must abandon.
L230013	u5446	m363	DRIVER	Ruptured steam pipe.
L230012	u5455	m363	NICKY	What do you mean, we must abandon?
L230011	u5446	m363	DRIVER	We must abandon.
L229951	u5446	m363	DRIVER	Very bad today.
L229950	u5455	m363	NICKY	Crosstown.
L229949	u5446	m363	DRIVER	You are going where?
L229948	u5455	m363	NICKY	I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
L229908	u5455	m363	NICKY	I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I peed under the Manhattan bridge. Peed many times in parks and playgrounds.
L229907	u5446	m363	DRIVER	Big mess every time.
L229906	u5455	m363	NICKY	What did you find?
L229905	u5446	m363	DRIVER	I opened thousands of brains.
L229904	u5455	m363	NICKY	Very big.
L229903	u5446	m363	DRIVER	I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
L229900	u5446	m363	DRIVER	Where you're going, mister?
L229899	u5455	m363	NICKY	I used to drive a taxi.
L230058	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Isn't she great? What did I tell you? A talent.
L230057	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Alla puttanesca.
L230056	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Say it again.
L230053	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
L230052	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	This is a great young out-of-work actress.
L230051	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Elliot?
L230050	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
L230049	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Guys ready to order?
L230325	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	She was very evasive.
L230324	u5455	m363	NICKY	Had to be him.
L230323	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
L230322	u5455	m363	NICKY	What do you mean?
L230321	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Paisley Porter.
L230320	u5455	m363	NICKY	How do you Eknow.
L230319	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Keep going west. Last building before the river.
L230318	u5455	m363	NICKY	Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
L230317	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	The American theater doesn't need people like that.
L230316	u5455	m363	NICKY	Shoot him.
L230313	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	There are things that speak to us from the past.
L230312	u5455	m363	NICKY	What?
L230311	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
L230310	u5455	m363	NICKY	We were thinking of putting in a pool.
L230309	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
L230308	u5455	m363	NICKY	He'll hate it.
L230307	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	It's your best play, Nicky.
L230306	u5455	m363	NICKY	In other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? The man is out there ruining lives.
L230303	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
L230302	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
L230301	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	No, we're not.
L230300	u5455	m363	NICKY	We're making too much of this.
L230297	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	That was a big mistake.
L230296	u5455	m363	NICKY	I gave it away. I thought, I'm a writer now.
L230295	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Where is it?
L230294	u5455	m363	NICKY	I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
L230293	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Then you should carry a gun.
L230292	u5455	m363	NICKY	He carries a gun.
L230113	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	What about the haircut?
L230112	u5455	m363	NICKY	Don't wait Efor me.
L230111	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Where are you going?
L230107	u5455	m363	NICKY	I don't have the problems that artists have.
L230106	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
L230105	u5455	m363	NICKY	Here we go.
L230104	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	I'm not ready.
L230103	u5455	m363	NICKY	Do not inhale.
L230102	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	You say we go?
L230101	u5455	m363	NICKY	I say we go.
L230100	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	I think we Nought to wait.
L230099	u5455	m363	NICKY	Do we care?
L230098	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Is it safe?
L230078	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	I said, `I'm dead'. He killed me.
L230077	u5455	m363	NICKY	What was it like?
L230076	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
L230046	u5455	m363	NICKY	A year and a half later? You're still brooding?
L230045	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
L230044	u5455	m363	NICKY	That's awful.
L230043	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
L230042	u5455	m363	NICKY	And he was there?
L230041	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
L230040	u5455	m363	NICKY	What happened eighteen months ago?
L230039	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	That's what I said eighteen months ago.
L230038	u5455	m363	NICKY	What's the fuss? I don't get it.
L230037	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
L230036	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's just a review.
L230035	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
L230034	u5455	m363	NICKY	You mean because What's-His-Name.
L230033	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
L230032	u5455	m363	NICKY	Tonight. What's tonight?
L230031	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Tonight you find out what it means to suffer.
L230030	u5455	m363	NICKY	Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
L230029	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	What do I exude?
L230028	u5455	m363	NICKY	You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
L230027	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
L230026	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.
L230024	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Do not inhale.
L230023	u5455	m363	NICKY	We must abandon.
L230022	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Asbestos lining.
L230021	u5455	m363	NICKY	Very dangerous.
L230010	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Joanna Bourne. So rich and crisp. This woman lets you touch her body? You put your hands on her personal parts?
L230009	u5455	m363	NICKY	Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
L230008	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	But didn't we know it would happen?
L230007	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm completely stunned. I don't want this to happen.
L230006	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
L230005	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's over, finished and done with.
L230004	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Don't talk like that.
L230003	u5455	m363	NICKY	She wants a divorce.
L230002	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	How is Lillian? I haven't seen her.
L230001	u5455	m363	NICKY	Ride with me. We need a haircut.
L230000	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Press a button and they give us money.
L229999	u5455	m363	NICKY	You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
L229998	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Quietly effective.
L229997	u5455	m363	NICKY	Shut up, Elliot.
L229996	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
L229995	u5455	m363	NICKY	I don't want to hear about it.
L229994	u5447	m363	ELLIOT	Nicky. I was thinking about you. I went to the preview last night.
L230520	u5455	m363	NICKY	You're not making sense. Make sense.
L230519	u5448	m363	FIRST MAN	Did you see the winning run score?
L230518	u5455	m363	NICKY	Of course I saw it.
L230513	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes. What are you implying?
L230512	u5448	m363	FIRST MAN	What are we talking about?
L230511	u5455	m363	NICKY	What are you talking about?
L230510	u5448	m363	FIRST MAN	I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
L230504	u5455	m363	NICKY	Classic.
L230503	u5448	m363	FIRST MAN	Unbelievable.
L230502	u5455	m363	NICKY	Great game.
L230368	u5457	m363	PETER	This could be it.
L230367	u5449	m363	JACK	This could be it.
L230366	u5457	m363	PETER	Does what feel comfortable?
L230365	u5449	m363	JACK	Does it feel comfortable?
L230364	u5457	m363	PETER	This could be it.
L230363	u5449	m363	JACK	This could be it.
L230362	u5457	m363	PETER	This could be it.
L230361	u5449	m363	JACK	This could be it.
L230200	u5457	m363	PETER	This could be it.
L230199	u5449	m363	JACK	This could Pbe it.
L230179	u5457	m363	PETER	Let's work on it.
L230178	u5449	m363	JACK	Let's work on it.
L230177	u5457	m363	PETER	This could be it.
L230176	u5449	m363	JACK	This could be it.
L229947	u5450	m363	JOANNA	He will absolutely hate it.
L229946	u5455	m363	NICKY	They'll lose because they're my team.
L229945	u5450	m363	JOANNA	It's your best play, Nicky.
L229944	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
L229943	u5450	m363	JOANNA	It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
L229942	u5455	m363	NICKY	The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
L229941	u5450	m363	JOANNA	I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
L229940	u5455	m363	NICKY	We don't even like each other, do we?
L229939	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Because we're completely mismatched.
L229938	u5455	m363	NICKY	In and out of bed.
L229937	u5450	m363	JOANNA	We're able to surprise each other.
L229936	u5455	m363	NICKY	This is how we've managed to last.
L229935	u5450	m363	JOANNA	I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
L229933	u5450	m363	JOANNA	It can't be all that personal.
L229932	u5455	m363	NICKY	Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
L229931	u5450	m363	JOANNA	You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
L229930	u5455	m363	NICKY	The Red Sox
L229929	u5450	m363	JOANNA	What?
L229928	u5455	m363	NICKY	They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
L229927	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
L229926	u5455	m363	NICKY	Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
L229925	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
L229924	u5455	m363	NICKY	About what?
L229923	u5450	m363	JOANNA	That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
L229922	u5455	m363	NICKY	I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
L229921	u5450	m363	JOANNA	They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
L229920	u5455	m363	NICKY	Can he get through it?
L229919	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
L229918	u5455	m363	NICKY	Our Peter?
L229917	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
L229916	u5455	m363	NICKY	I talked to her two days ago.
L229915	u5450	m363	JOANNA	She died.
L229914	u5455	m363	NICKY	She's dying.
L229913	u5450	m363	JOANNA	What about her?
L229912	u5455	m363	NICKY	You know about Adele.
L229911	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
L229910	u5455	m363	NICKY	I hear Alan's sick.
L229909	u5450	m363	JOANNA	Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
L230572	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Daddy, wait.
L230571	u5455	m363	NICKY	I see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.
L230569	u5455	m363	NICKY	There's nothing left for me to lie about.
L230568	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Will I believe you when you tell me something?
L230567	u5455	m363	NICKY	Everything.
L230566	u5451	m363	LAUREL	What will we talk about?
L230564	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
L230563	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Except I won't have a father anymore.
L230562	u5455	m363	NICKY	Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around.
L230227	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I'm not sure.
L230226	u5455	m363	NICKY	Can we talk later? Will you be at the party?
L230225	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I have a class. I'm late.
L230224	u5455	m363	NICKY	And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
L230223	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
L230222	u5455	m363	NICKY	Take it yourself. Take a date.
L230221	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
L230220	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
L230219	u5455	m363	NICKY	Opening night?
L230218	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
L230217	u5455	m363	NICKY	Laurel. Tickets are all set. I double-checked.
L229991	u5455	m363	NICKY	This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
L229990	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
L229989	u5455	m363	NICKY	Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
L229988	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
L229986	u5455	m363	NICKY	Your mother and I have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. Believe me, I know this. That's right, nineteen years. And what about the days and minutes? Sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. We're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. Lillian isn't only my wife. She's my best friend.
L229985	u5451	m363	LAUREL	She is kicking you out.
L229984	u5455	m363	NICKY	You're too young to be studying criminal behavior. It's making you obsessive.
L229983	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Oh please. Not now.  She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
L229982	u5455	m363	NICKY	Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
L229981	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
L229980	u5455	m363	NICKY	I just had breakfast with her. She didn't say a word about this.
L229979	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
L229978	u5455	m363	NICKY	If lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?
L229968	u5455	m363	NICKY	And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
L229967	u5451	m363	LAUREL	She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
L229966	u5455	m363	NICKY	Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
L229965	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Is it?
L229964	u5455	m363	NICKY	That's completely crazy.
L229963	u5451	m363	LAUREL	So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
L229962	u5455	m363	NICKY	Why do you need a radio?
L229961	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
L229960	u5455	m363	NICKY	What do you want to talk about? I'll talk about anything. What's this?
L229959	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
L229958	u5455	m363	NICKY	Do you want to get some coffee?
L229957	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I go to college. I thought you knew.
L229956	u5455	m363	NICKY	I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
L230596	u5460	m363	STEVEN	And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
L230595	u5451	m363	LAUREL	See, Daddy.
L230592	u5460	m363	STEVEN	An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
L230591	u5451	m363	LAUREL	What else?
L230590	u5460	m363	STEVEN	I've seen it twice. I went back tonight to be sure. It's a brave and honest piece of work.
L230589	u5451	m363	LAUREL	See, Daddy.
L230588	u5460	m363	STEVEN	It's your best play, Nicky.
L230587	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
L230559	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Yes.
L230558	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Am I really so deeply repugnant?
L230549	u5451	m363	LAUREL	You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
L230548	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
L230547	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
L230546	u5460	m363	STEVEN	What's sexy?
L230545	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
L230544	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Mystery. Deception.
L230543	u5451	m363	LAUREL	What do we want?
L230542	u5460	m363	STEVEN	We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
L230541	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
L230540	u5460	m363	STEVEN	This building is not secure.
L230539	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Yes.
L230538	u5460	m363	STEVEN	If you're wondering about the firearm.
L230535	u5451	m363	LAUREL	A flat-out hit.
L230534	u5460	m363	STEVEN	What else?
L230533	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Packs an emotional wallop.
L230532	u5460	m363	STEVEN	What else?
L230531	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Brilliantly moving.
L230530	u5460	m363	STEVEN	First you tell me.
L230529	u5451	m363	LAUREL	You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
L230528	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Names are incredibly intimate. We barely know each other. Trust me on this.
L230527	u5451	m363	LAUREL	I'm willing to tell you my name.
L230526	u5460	m363	STEVEN	It's only our first date.
L230525	u5451	m363	LAUREL	Why won't you tell me your name?
L230422	u5455	m363	NICKY	I feel great. I feel impeccably alive. I'm elated. Eat something. Please. I love you.
L230421	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I'm glad we're having this talk.
L230420	u5455	m363	NICKY	We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
L230419	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
L230418	u5455	m363	NICKY	It was an animal thing. No real intimacy.
L230417	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	It violates so many trusts.
L230416	u5455	m363	NICKY	I am really, deeply sorry.
L230415	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	She's my gynecologist.
L230414	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
L230413	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
L230412	u5455	m363	NICKY	Alma Wetzel.
L230411	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	Joanne Bourne.
L230410	u5455	m363	NICKY	I had an affair -- are you sure you want to hear this?
L230409	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
L230408	u5455	m363	NICKY	There may be things you'd rather not know about.
L230407	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	Be open with me. I'd like that.
L230406	u5455	m363	NICKY	Laurel wants us to be honest and open. Let's be open with each other.
L230405	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	That's very lovely actually.
L230404	u5455	m363	NICKY	I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
L230403	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I'd forgotten that.
L230402	u5455	m363	NICKY	You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
L230401	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
L230400	u5455	m363	NICKY	And you've been extremely patient.
L230399	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	That's always been my problem.
L230398	u5455	m363	NICKY	The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
L230397	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	Who the hell cares?
L230396	u5455	m363	NICKY	Opening night, Lillian.
L230392	u5455	m363	NICKY	Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
L230391	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
L230390	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'll have whatever she's having.
L230389	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
L230388	u5455	m363	NICKY	How prominent?
L230387	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
L230386	u5455	m363	NICKY	All right. What's been going on?
L230385	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
L230384	u5455	m363	NICKY	We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
L230383	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
L230382	u5455	m363	NICKY	Two-all after six.
L230381	u5452	m363	LILLIAN	Your father said you might be here.
L230500	u5455	m363	NICKY	Life is real.
L230499	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	Life is true.
L230493	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	This could be it!
L230492	u5455	m363	NICKY	This could be it!
L230484	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	You're hurting my head.
L230483	u5455	m363	NICKY	A thousand things.
L230482	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	What did it say?
L230481	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
L230474	u5455	m363	NICKY	One more out.
L230473	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	Washed away.
L230472	u5455	m363	NICKY	All the failures, all the fatalism.
L230452	u5455	m363	NICKY	I don't know if I can say that.
L230451	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	People are dependable.
L230446	u5455	m363	NICKY	Life is good.
L230445	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	Life is good.
L230425	u5455	m363	NICKY	They're always winning. Until they lose.
L230424	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	Great game. Red Sox are winning.
L230370	u5455	m363	NICKY	I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
L230369	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	What's it like to shoot somebody?
L230354	u5455	m363	NICKY	This place becomes famous. Tour buses. Blind people feeling around for bullet holes in the wall.
L230353	u5453	m363	MATTHEW	What happens if somebody comes in here right now and shoots you?
L230291	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Show him who we are.
L230290	u5455	m363	NICKY	What do you want me to do?
L230289	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	So what are you going to do about it?
L230288	u5455	m363	NICKY	I was in a hurry to do big things, make big mistakes. Any mistakes were okay as long as it was big. But I'm trying to see these things clearly and honestly. That's the play they're going to kill starting tonight. There's a guy out there getting ready to rip it apart. And that's us. Who we were and where we come from.
L230287	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	You tell your friends your father used to work the docks. Callused hands. But you had an attitude when you were growing up that wasn't easy for your mother and me to understand.
L230286	u5455	m363	NICKY	Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
L230285	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
L230284	u5455	m363	NICKY	I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
L230283	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
L230282	u5455	m363	NICKY	I know, Pop.
L230281	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	`Why doesn't he come live with us?' Because everything is here.
L230278	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'll go get you another one. You have to wear it.
L230277	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	I lost it. I lose everything.
L230276	u5455	m363	NICKY	You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
L230275	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	I can't find it.
L230274	u5455	m363	NICKY	Where's your elastic brace?
L230273	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	My back is killing me.
L230272	u5455	m363	NICKY	Let's not start that again.
L230271	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Since when did that matter?
L230270	u5455	m363	NICKY	Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
L230269	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
L230268	u5455	m363	NICKY	You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
L230267	u5455	m363	NICKY	I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
L230266	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	But the son is suppose to stop crying.
L230265	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
L230264	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
L230263	u5455	m363	NICKY	Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
L230262	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
L230261	u5455	m363	NICKY	Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
L230260	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	They're only gonna lose.
L230259	u5455	m363	NICKY	I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
L230258	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	You know the answer to that.
L230257	u5455	m363	NICKY	Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
L230256	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
L230255	u5455	m363	NICKY	We must have been heroic.
L230254	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Get yourself something to eat.
L230253	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
L230252	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
L230251	u5455	m363	NICKY	Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
L230250	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
L230249	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm on my way to get a haircut.
L230248	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	If it's you, what are you doing here?
L230247	u5455	m363	NICKY	Where are your glasses? Go get them.
L230246	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Nicky comes on Sunday's.
L230245	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's me. Nicky.
L230244	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	What do you want?
L230243	u5455	m363	NICKY	Right here. At the door.
L230242	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Where the hell are you?
L230241	u5455	m363	NICKY	Pop, will you let me in?
L230240	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Go way. I'll call a cop.
L230239	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm at the door.
L230238	u5454	m363	MICHAEL	Who is it?
L230495	u5455	m363	NICKY	This could be it!
L230494	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	This could be it!
L230480	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
L230479	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Don't worry. It's a test.
L230471	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Because faith is rewarded.
L230470	u5455	m363	NICKY	Because life is good.
L230469	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Washed away.
L230468	u5455	m363	NICKY	All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
L230466	u5455	m363	NICKY	He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
L230465	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Because God loves a winner.
L230464	u5455	m363	NICKY	This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
L230450	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Matthew.
L230449	u5455	m363	NICKY	I don't know.
L230444	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
L230443	u5455	m363	NICKY	Life is good.
L230442	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Then say it.
L230441	u5455	m363	NICKY	I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
L230440	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
L230435	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
L230434	u5455	m363	NICKY	I want to believe.
L230433	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
L230432	u5455	m363	NICKY	It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day.
L230431	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
L230428	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
L230427	u5455	m363	NICKY	Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
L230426	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
L230380	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	It's a simple subject.
L230379	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's a complicated subject.
L230378	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
L230377	u5455	m363	NICKY	I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
L230376	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
L230375	u5455	m363	NICKY	Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
L230374	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	You're a family man, Frankie?
L230372	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's complicated. It's a whole life. A person doesn't commit an act of violence out of nowhere. There are strong forces at work.
L230371	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
L230360	u5455	m363	NICKY	That's my cousin, Angelo.
L230359	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
L230358	u5455	m363	NICKY	Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
L230357	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	You're charming the boy.
L230356	u5455	m363	NICKY	What am I doing?
L230355	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	You see what you're doing, don't you?
L230348	u5455	m363	NICKY	Look, we're stuck here front and back. It's dinnertime for you, game time for me. Let's park the cab and go to Mannion's. What do you say, Matthew? We'll drink beer and talk baseball.
L230347	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	That's a simple subject.
L230346	u5455	m363	NICKY	Now that's a complicated subject.
L230345	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
L230344	u5455	m363	NICKY	It's the kid's lucky day.
L230343	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
L230342	u5455	m363	NICKY	A grandmother. God bless you.
L230341	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Matthew's my grandson.
L230340	u5455	m363	NICKY	How come you got the kid with you?
L230339	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
L230338	u5455	m363	NICKY	Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
L230337	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
L230336	u5455	m363	NICKY	Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
L230335	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
L230334	u5455	m363	NICKY	Oh yeah?
L230333	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
L230332	u5455	m363	NICKY	Everybody else does. Why not you?
L230331	u5461	m363	TOYOTA	I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
L230594	u5460	m363	STEVEN	You're out of bullets.
L230593	u5455	m363	NICKY	And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
L230586	u5455	m363	NICKY	What about my play?
L230585	u5460	m363	STEVEN	When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
L230584	u5455	m363	NICKY	I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
L230583	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Because I can't bear to watch. When they lose, I die inside. It's like some little person named Steve just crumples up and dies. I wait for the scores. I still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. I can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. I've done it too many times. And I can't do it anymore.
L230582	u5455	m363	NICKY	If you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? Answer carefully. This is important. You could have gone to the theater last night. There was no game last night.
L230581	u5460	m363	STEVEN	The Red Sox were my world. I surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.
L230580	u5455	m363	NICKY	I went to college in Boston so I could be near the Red Sox. I took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. My wife is from Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
L230579	u5460	m363	STEVEN	They're my team, too. I grew up on Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway Park. I went to fifty or sixty games a year. All by myself. I was one of those kids with scabby elbows. I called out to the players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm Steven. My parents are divorced.'
L230578	u5455	m363	NICKY	No. They're not your team. They're my team.
L230577	u5460	m363	STEVEN	They're my team.
L230576	u5455	m363	NICKY	Why do you care?
L230575	u5460	m363	STEVEN	If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
L230574	u5455	m363	NICKY	Why does it matter?
L230573	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Then they lost?
L230142	u5459	m363	SIDNEY	You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
L230141	u5455	m363	NICKY	I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
L230140	u5459	m363	SIDNEY	Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
L230139	u5455	m363	NICKY	Postpone. We have every right.
L230138	u5459	m363	SIDNEY	Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
L230137	u5455	m363	NICKY	'm not worried about this kid.
L230136	u5459	m363	SIDNEY	So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
L230135	u5455	m363	NICKY	hat was this morning.
L230134	u5459	m363	SIDNEY	I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
L230133	u5455	m363	NICKY	appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
L230132	u5459	m363	SIDNEY	Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
L230131	u5455	m363	NICKY	aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
L230515	u5455	m363	NICKY	You're not making sense.
L230514	u5458	m363	SECOND MAN	Game six is history,pal.
L230509	u5455	m363	NICKY	Eleventh inning. What else?
L230508	u5458	m363	SECOND MAN	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
L230507	u5455	m363	NICKY	Have to hurry back.
L230064	u5455	m363	NICKY	When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
L230063	u5458	m363	SECOND MAN	How come?
L230062	u5455	m363	NICKY	I hate the Mets.
L230457	u5462	m363	WAITER	But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
L230456	u5455	m363	NICKY	"Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know ""Macbeth""."
L230394	u5455	m363	NICKY	Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
L230393	u5462	m363	WAITER	Yessiree, Bob.
L230073	u5462	m363	WAITER	Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
L230072	u5455	m363	NICKY	Why?
L230071	u5462	m363	WAITER	To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
L230070	u5455	m363	NICKY	What do you mean?
L230175	u5457	m363	PETER	I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
L230174	u5455	m363	NICKY	This could be it.
L230171	u5457	m363	PETER	That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
L230170	u5455	m363	NICKY	And the Father replies?
L230162	u5457	m363	PETER	I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
L230161	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes.
L230160	u5457	m363	PETER	I kissed her while she was laughing.
L230159	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes.
L230158	u5457	m363	PETER	This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
L230157	u5455	m363	NICKY	Mine was cobalt blue.
L230156	u5457	m363	PETER	Burnt sienna.
L230155	u5455	m363	NICKY	What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
L230154	u5457	m363	PETER	What color?
L230153	u5455	m363	NICKY	You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
L230152	u5457	m363	PETER	But my parasite is consuming all the new memories. Eating my lines.
L230151	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes, Peter.
L230150	u5457	m363	PETER	I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
L230149	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes.
L230148	u5457	m363	PETER	I have excellent long-term memory.
L230147	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes.
L230146	u5457	m363	PETER	I was educated by nuns.
L230145	u5455	m363	NICKY	Sidney Fabrikant. Our producer.
L230144	u5457	m363	PETER	Sidney.
L230143	u5455	m363	NICKY	Sidney remains optimistic.
L230202	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
L230201	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
L230198	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	He goes to the theater armed.
L230197	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes.
L230196	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Our Steven not only disguises himself.
L230195	u5455	m363	NICKY	What? Come on, Paisley.
L230194	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Never mind.
L230193	u5455	m363	NICKY	Yes.
L230192	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
L230191	u5455	m363	NICKY	I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
L230190	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
L230189	u5455	m363	NICKY	So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
L230188	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
L230187	u5455	m363	NICKY	There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
L230186	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	No one's waiting.
L230185	u5455	m363	NICKY	Someone waiting for you?
L230184	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Home.
L230183	u5455	m363	NICKY	Where are you going now?
L230182	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	He's a very sweet man.
L230181	u5455	m363	NICKY	I don't know.
L230180	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Do you think he can do it?
L230129	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
L230128	u5455	m363	NICKY	But you're his friend.
L230127	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
L230126	u5455	m363	NICKY	He wears a disguise.
L230125	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Is what true?
L230124	u5455	m363	NICKY	Is it true?
L230123	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	The fact is, I have to get going.
L230122	u5455	m363	NICKY	I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
L230121	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
L230120	u5455	m363	NICKY	Would you like to meet him?
L230119	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
L230118	u5455	m363	NICKY	So do I. Over and over.
L230117	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I hear good things about the new play.
L230116	u5455	m363	NICKY	I was all noise. Played the radio loud. Battled constantly with my brother and sister. Here I am, world.
L230115	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
L230114	u5455	m363	NICKY	You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
L230097	u5455	m363	NICKY	One more time.
L230096	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Alla puttanesca.
L230095	u5455	m363	NICKY	You know what.
L230094	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	What?
L230093	u5455	m363	NICKY	Say it again.
L230092	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	A little drastic maybe?
L230091	u5455	m363	NICKY	Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
L230090	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Engaging.
L230089	u5455	m363	NICKY	Endearing.
L230088	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
L230087	u5455	m363	NICKY	And he has finer moments now and then.
L230086	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	A little.
L230085	u5455	m363	NICKY	Oh. You know him.
L230084	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Not one of Steven's finer moments.
L230083	u5455	m363	NICKY	So does Elliot.
L230082	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I think I remember.
L230081	u5455	m363	NICKY	There was a review.
L230080	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
L230079	u5455	m363	NICKY	You've worked with Elliot?
L230055	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
L230054	u5455	m363	NICKY	What's good?
L230215	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I'm going home to my machine.
L230214	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Stay. Teach me to be compassionate.
L230213	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I don't want you, Steven.
L230212	u5460	m363	STEVEN	And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
L230211	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
L230210	u5460	m363	STEVEN	The truth is never gentle. Listen to me carefully. Each of us lives in the thinnest possible wrapping of wishes and dreams. Truth is the force that penetrates this wispy skin. It hurts and maims.
L230209	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
L230208	u5460	m363	STEVEN	Of course it's unfair. The truth is always unfair. Why do you think I live this way? Hiding out. Stealing electricity from a lamp post. Because people who write the truth are outcasts of society. I can't live openly, in a nice clean doorman building, with my name on the mailbox. They'd come after me in packs.
L230207	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
L230206	u5460	m363	STEVEN	But you're here. So you must have come to me.
L230205	u5456	m363	PAISLEY	I haven't come to you.
L230204	u5460	m363	STEVEN	You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.
L326969	u6136	m408	JERRY	You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
L326968	u6130	m408	AVERY	Oh Jerry.
L326967	u6136	m408	JERRY	No.
L326966	u6130	m408	AVERY	I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
L326965	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'm not trying to make history. _ 67.
L326964	u6130	m408	AVERY	No one has ever dumped me.
L326963	u6136	m408	JERRY	Listen to me, it's over.
L326962	u6130	m408	AVERY	You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
L326961	u6136	m408	JERRY	There is something missing here.
L326960	u6130	m408	AVERY	Didn't hear it.
L326959	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's over --
L326958	u6130	m408	AVERY	No.
L326957	u6136	m408	JERRY	Listen to me!
L326953	u6136	m408	JERRY	-- stop --
L326952	u6130	m408	AVERY	Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
L326949	u6136	m408	JERRY	"I think you added the ""brutal."""
L326948	u6130	m408	AVERY	What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
L326947	u6136	m408	JERRY	Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
L326945	u6136	m408	JERRY	Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
L326944	u6130	m408	AVERY	"It's not ""love me.""  It's not ""trust my handshake.""  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be ""confusion"" about that."
L326943	u6136	m408	JERRY	Look, I don't want a --
L326942	u6130	m408	AVERY	Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
L326941	u6136	m408	JERRY	Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
L326940	u6130	m408	AVERY	I have to finish my job --
L326939	u6136	m408	JERRY	Could you just stop moving?
L326938	u6130	m408	AVERY	It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
L326936	u6130	m408	AVERY	Oh honey.  It's spun.
L326935	u6136	m408	JERRY	What do I do?  How do I spin this?
L326934	u6130	m408	AVERY	I just heard.
L326862	u6130	m408	AVERY	Jerry!  Do something --
L326861	u6136	m408	JERRY	This can't be happening to me.
L326837	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's a plan --  -- _ 51.
L326836	u6130	m408	AVERY	You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
L326835	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well, no you didn't --
L326834	u6130	m408	AVERY	Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
L326833	u6136	m408	JERRY	I know.  Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
L326786	u6130	m408	AVERY	Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
L326785	u6136	m408	JERRY	Now.
L326784	u6130	m408	AVERY	I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
L326783	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Who said anything about ""loser?"" Where do you get this word ""loser?"""
L326782	u6130	m408	AVERY	You are not a loser.
L326781	u6136	m408	JERRY	Okay, this is working.
L326780	u6130	m408	AVERY	King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
L326779	u6136	m408	JERRY	That's right.
L326778	u6130	m408	AVERY	Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
L326777	u6136	m408	JERRY	I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
L326776	u6130	m408	AVERY	Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
L326775	u6136	m408	JERRY	Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
L326774	u6130	m408	AVERY	Ugh!
L326773	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
L326772	u6130	m408	AVERY	And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
L326771	u6136	m408	JERRY	The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
L326621	u6136	m408	JERRY	One of the accountants.
L326620	u6130	m408	AVERY	Who told you?
L326619	u6136	m408	JERRY	I know about the bachelor party.
L326618	u6130	m408	AVERY	Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
L326617	u6130	m408	AVERY	Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
L326616	u6136	m408	JERRY	You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
L326613	u6130	m408	AVERY	Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
L326612	u6136	m408	JERRY	Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
L326611	u6130	m408	AVERY	Don't ever stop fucking me!
L327182	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Still going.
L327181	u6131	m408	CHAD	Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
L327180	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	He's asleep, right?
L327142	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
L327141	u6131	m408	CHAD	Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
L327140	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Don't let him stay up too late.
L326829	u6131	m408	CHAD	Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
L326828	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Wait.  Did I just say hon"" to him?"
L326908	u6132	m408	CUSH	Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
L326907	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Just be friendly and say ""no comment."""
L326906	u6132	m408	CUSH	Reporters, Jerry.  They been callin' all night.
L326898	u6132	m408	CUSH	Something in the way.  Yeah.
L326897	u6136	m408	JERRY	Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
L326896	u6132	m408	CUSH	"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
L326895	u6136	m408	JERRY	Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
L326855	u6136	m408	JERRY	Wait.  What do you mean?
L326854	u6132	m408	CUSH	I see what you're saying.
L326853	u6136	m408	JERRY	Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
L327253	u6133	m408	DOOLER	Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
L327252	u6136	m408	JERRY	Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
L327247	u6136	m408	JERRY	Bill, Rod, wait --
L327246	u6133	m408	DOOLER	Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
L326636	u6133	m408	DOOLER	They ain't laughing, man. Something's wrong.
L326635	u6136	m408	JERRY	... this is... uh... too funny...
L326627	u6136	m408	JERRY	You're imagining it.
L326626	u6133	m408	DOOLER	This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
L326625	u6136	m408	JERRY	Oh come on --
L326624	u6133	m408	DOOLER	You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
L327456	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
L327455	u6136	m408	JERRY	This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
L327392	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
L327391	u6136	m408	JERRY	So this break... is a break-up.
L327390	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
L327389	u6136	m408	JERRY	What about Ray?
L327388	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, responsible""... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break."
L327387	u6136	m408	JERRY	I don't like to give up.
L327386	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
L327385	u6136	m408	JERRY	"What if it's true?  ""Great at friendship bad at intimacy."" I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --"
L327384	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I think we made a mistake here.
L327383	u6136	m408	JERRY	Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
L327382	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
L327381	u6136	m408	JERRY	...my soul or something. _ 117.
L327380	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I don't know --
L327379	u6136	m408	JERRY	You want...
L327378	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	"I don't need you to ""stick."""
L327377	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
L327376	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
L327375	u6136	m408	JERRY	Tell me -- let me help --
L327374	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	It's not fair to you.  This whole --
L327373	u6136	m408	JERRY	What --
L327372	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	It's my fault.
L327368	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Why do you love me?
L327367	u6136	m408	JERRY	Why do you love me?
L327366	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Okay... I will...
L327365	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well, when you wonder, ask me.
L327364	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	And I really don't know your noises yet.
L327363	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
L327362	u6136	m408	JERRY	I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
L327300	u6136	m408	JERRY	Will you marry me?
L327299	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
L327298	u6136	m408	JERRY	If I said that, would you stay?
L327293	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
L327292	u6136	m408	JERRY	What --
L327289	u6136	m408	JERRY	So I'll see you this weekend.
L327288	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	This rig? Phht.  No problem.
L327287	u6136	m408	JERRY	Sure you're okay to drive this?
L327227	u6136	m408	JERRY	And I appreciate that impulse.
L327226	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Fine, I just --
L327225	u6136	m408	JERRY	Another time, okay Dorothy?
L327201	u6136	m408	JERRY	Easy, easy --
L327200	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh God.
L327179	u6136	m408	JERRY	Oh hell yes.
L327178	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
L327177	u6136	m408	JERRY	Right.  I'll come in.
L327176	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
L327175	u6136	m408	JERRY	Same to you.
L327174	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
L327171	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Good night.
L327170	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well -- this would be goodnight.
L327166	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Let's not tell our sad stories.
L327165	u6136	m408	JERRY	What?
L327164	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
L327160	u6136	m408	JERRY	No no no.  I just underestimated her...  her temper, I guess.  Why are we even talking about this?
L327159	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Maybe you should call her.
L327154	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
L327153	u6136	m408	JERRY	"It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, ""it's nobody's fault."" It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --"
L327146	u6136	m408	JERRY	Bye you guys. _ 88.
L327145	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
L327139	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
L327138	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
L327137	u6136	m408	JERRY	Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
L327130	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
L327129	u6136	m408	JERRY	You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
L327128	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh good.
L327127	u6136	m408	JERRY	I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
L327126	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I'm relieved you said that.
L327125	u6136	m408	JERRY	We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
L327124	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Yeah, what happened there.
L327123	u6136	m408	JERRY	Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
L327122	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	You don't have to explain.
L327121	u6136	m408	JERRY	I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
L327120	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Plus, you could use that commission.
L327119	u6136	m408	JERRY	Good.  Good.  Glad is good.
L327118	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	"Actually he said ""glad."" _ 85."
L327117	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Happy. He said ""happy?"""
L327116	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
L327078	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Good evening.
L327077	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well, good evening.
L327076	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I may not sue.
L327075	u6136	m408	JERRY	No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
L327074	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
L327073	u6136	m408	JERRY	Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
L327072	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Yeah, I did.
L327071	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Oh shit.  You said ""boss."""
L327070	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Don't worry about it, boss.
L327069	u6136	m408	JERRY	Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
L327068	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Well.
L327067	u6136	m408	JERRY	Mission... statement...
L327066	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I'm working with you because of that memo...
L327065	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
L327064	u6136	m408	JERRY	Me too.
L327062	u6136	m408	JERRY	Sure.
L327061	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Truth?
L327059	u6136	m408	JERRY	And I am...
L327058	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	-- especially one like this.
L327057	u6136	m408	JERRY	We will be fine!
L327056	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
L327050	u6136	m408	JERRY	Good idea.  Thank you.
L327049	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
L327019	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yeah, thanks.
L327018	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Beer okay?
L327015	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Sure --
L327014	u6136	m408	JERRY	Do you have something to drink?
L327013	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
L327012	u6136	m408	JERRY	And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
L327011	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
L327010	u6136	m408	JERRY	Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
L327009	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Too bad.
L327008	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
L327007	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh my God.
L327006	u6136	m408	JERRY	"I'm glad you're home.  That ""alone"" thing is... not my specialty..."
L327005	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
L327004	u6136	m408	JERRY	Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
L327003	u6136	m408	JERRY	Hi.
L327002	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Hey you.
L326847	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
L326846	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
L326827	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Call me later, hon.
L326826	u6136	m408	JERRY	Thanks.
L326825	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
L326824	u6136	m408	JERRY	Happy for us.
L326823	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Well, I'm happy for you.
L326822	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
L326821	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I just got goosebumps.
L326820	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's all going to work.
L326819	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	We are?
L326818	u6136	m408	JERRY	Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back.  I re-signed Cush. We're set.
L326816	u6136	m408	JERRY	Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
L326815	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	... light.
L326814	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
L326813	u6136	m408	JERRY	No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
L326812	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
L326811	u6136	m408	JERRY	Hello?
L326810	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
L326753	u6136	m408	JERRY	Same to you.
L326752	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	That took guts.
L326749	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Absolutely.
L326748	u6136	m408	JERRY	But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
L326747	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	No no, I know --
L326746	u6136	m408	JERRY	Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
L326745	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
L326744	u6136	m408	JERRY	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
L326743	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
L326742	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	"My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said ""you complete me."" _ 40."
L326741	u6136	m408	JERRY	Wonder what he said.
L326606	u6136	m408	JERRY	Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
L326605	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
L326599	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	"-- the part about ""we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm"" --"
L326598	u6136	m408	JERRY	I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
L326597	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh tsht. Yes.
L326596	u6136	m408	JERRY	You think so?
L326595	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
L326592	u6136	m408	JERRY	"No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it.  I already had my bachelor party.  It was called ""my twenties."" See you later."
L326591	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
L326590	u6136	m408	JERRY	No no. I knew.
L326589	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh no.
L326588	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	And have fun at your bachelor party.
L326587	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well, take care.
L326586	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Well, thanks.
L326583	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	My son... my mind...
L326582	u6136	m408	JERRY	Now what did you lose?
L326581	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Hmm.  Pretty good.
L326580	u6136	m408	JERRY	I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
L326579	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
L326578	u6136	m408	JERRY	Can I help?
L326555	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh, tell the story.
L326554	u6136	m408	JERRY	No no...
L327198	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
L327197	u6137	m408	LAUREL	Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
L327195	u6137	m408	LAUREL	Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
L327194	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Please, if I start talking --
L327193	u6137	m408	LAUREL	Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
L327192	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	No--
L327191	u6137	m408	LAUREL	First you gotta tell me something.
L327151	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
L327150	u6137	m408	LAUREL	No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
L327149	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
L327148	u6137	m408	LAUREL	Forgot your keys --
L327035	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Thanks.
L327034	u6137	m408	LAUREL	Good.
L327033	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
L327027	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	As opposed to twenty angry women?
L327026	u6137	m408	LAUREL	But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
L327025	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	That's the girl I love.
L327024	u6137	m408	LAUREL	Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
L327023	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Thank you.
L327022	u6137	m408	LAUREL	This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
L327021	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
L327020	u6137	m408	LAUREL	I heard.
L326994	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
L326993	u6137	m408	LAUREL	"Dotty -- this is not ""guy."". This is a ""syndrome.""  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you."
L326992	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
L326991	u6137	m408	LAUREL	At eleven at night? _ 70.
L326990	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	He's coming over.
L326764	u6137	m408	LAUREL	He's in the living room asleep.
L326763	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Wait. Where is he?
L326760	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Of course I know --
L326759	u6137	m408	LAUREL	You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
L326758	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
L326757	u6137	m408	LAUREL	You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
L326756	u6134	m408	DOROTHY	Of course, medical! _ 42.
L326755	u6137	m408	LAUREL	What about medical?
L327467	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
L327466	u6135	m408	FIRESTONE	Ten seconds, Rod.
L327465	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
L327462	u6135	m408	FIRESTONE	It's only a half-hour show, Rod.
L327461	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I... I love everybody, man.  I love my wife.  My kids.  Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee.  My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
L327460	u6135	m408	FIRESTONE	-- well, Rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. He says that your deal memo has been signed by the Arizona Cardinals. Four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  Playing in the state where you grew up.
L327459	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	No, Roy.  I'm not gonna cry.
L326928	u6139	m408	MATT	We signed an hour ago.  You were in the lobby with the black fella.
L326927	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Now.  Wait.  You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign.  Because I'm still sort of moved by your ""my word is stronger'n oak"" thing --"
L326922	u6136	m408	JERRY	I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
L326921	u6139	m408	MATT	I'm sorry, I --
L326920	u6136	m408	JERRY	So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
L326919	u6139	m408	MATT	Hey, I'm learning as I go.
L326918	u6136	m408	JERRY	Said who?  Sugar?
L326917	u6139	m408	MATT	Apparently, Denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
L326916	u6136	m408	JERRY	Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
L326915	u6139	m408	MATT	Not right now, Jerry.
L326903	u6136	m408	JERRY	Denver got very silent about a day ago.  San Diego's got a fever for Cush.  This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  People get crazy.  And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight.  Million.
L326902	u6139	m408	MATT	What happened to Denver?
L326804	u6139	m408	MATT	"You know I don't do ""contracts."" But'cha do have my word, and it's stronger than oak."
L326803	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'll give it everything.
L326802	u6139	m408	MATT	Denver is where he should be.
L326800	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
L326799	u6139	m408	MATT	I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
L326797	u6136	m408	JERRY	You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
L326796	u6139	m408	MATT	Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
L326795	u6136	m408	JERRY	Oh, thank you.
L326794	u6139	m408	MATT	We decided to stay with you.
L326793	u6136	m408	JERRY	Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI.  But to me --
L327411	u6136	m408	JERRY	I missed ya.  What can I say?
L327410	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Thanks for coming.
L327409	u6136	m408	JERRY	Go.  Flee.
L327408	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Jerry!  You made it --
L327354	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
L327353	u6136	m408	JERRY	We still having dinner in L.A.?
L327352	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Beautiful.
L327351	u6136	m408	JERRY	Fine.
L327350	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I don't want to be friends anymore.
L327349	u6136	m408	JERRY	Airight.  Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player.  You play with your head.  Not your heart.  In your personal life?  Heart. But when you get on the field --  _ 113.
L327348	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I think so.
L327347	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our ""friends"" hats on --"
L327346	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Why not --
L327345	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really ""friends?"""
L327344	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	For loyalty, you buy a dog.  For love, you get married.
L327343	u6136	m408	JERRY	Damn right.
L327342	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	That's an answer.
L327341	u6136	m408	JERRY	No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
L327340	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I'm sorry I asked.
L327339	u6136	m408	JERRY	You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
L327338	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
L327337	u6136	m408	JERRY	Not everyone has what you have.
L327336	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
L327335	u6136	m408	JERRY	No, you're --
L327334	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I'm asking you a question --
L327333	u6136	m408	JERRY	Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
L327332	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You don't want to go home, do you?
L327331	u6136	m408	JERRY	"I don't know -- how's ""dedication"" for an answer?"
L327330	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
L327329	u6136	m408	JERRY	What's that supposed to mean?
L327328	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
L327327	u6136	m408	JERRY	Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
L327326	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
L327324	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Hey, that's my word, okay?
L327323	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
L327322	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	No.
L327321	u6136	m408	JERRY	We can still take the offer, Rod.
L327318	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I'm worried too.  I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
L327317	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'm a little worried --
L327316	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man.  He's gonna get me killed.
L327309	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Well, this was another way to go.
L327308	u6136	m408	JERRY	No.
L327307	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You never had The Talk, did you?
L327270	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Shame on you.  SHAME on you.
L327269	u6136	m408	JERRY	"I didn't ""shoplift the pooty.""  We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who --  Alright, I shoplifted the pooty."
L327268	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"No.  A real man does not shoplift the ""pooty"" from a single mom."
L327267	u6136	m408	JERRY	The kid is amazing.
L327266	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
L327265	u6136	m408	JERRY	But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
L327264	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Then you gotta have The Talk.
L327263	u6136	m408	JERRY	No, I don't know.
L327262	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
L327261	u6136	m408	JERRY	How do I know?
L327260	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"First, single mothers don't ""date."" They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?"
L327259	u6136	m408	JERRY	Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
L327258	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Oh I know plenty.  I was raised by a single mother.
L327257	u6136	m408	JERRY	What do you know about dating a single mother?
L327256	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Oh, we gonna be friends now?
L327255	u6136	m408	JERRY	Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
L327249	u6136	m408	JERRY	Rod, get on the camel.
L327248	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
L327239	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Good deal, man.
L327238	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'll get you some quick work --
L327236	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's a risk.
L327235	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
L327234	u6136	m408	JERRY	If you get injured, you get nothing.
L327113	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  And I dig that about you.
L327112	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'm out here for you!  You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
L327111	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	No tell me. _ 84.
L327110	u6136	m408	JERRY	Forget it.  Forget it.
L327109	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	What's wrong.
L327107	u6136	m408	JERRY	Fine.
L327106	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
L327105	u6136	m408	JERRY	Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
L327104	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Love me love me love me... put me on t.v.  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
L327103	u6136	m408	JERRY	No, I'm saying to be --
L327102	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You're telling me to dance.
L327098	u6136	m408	JERRY	You.
L327097	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Is that your porty or mine?
L327096	u6136	m408	JERRY	Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
L327095	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	No, I air-dry.
L327094	u6136	m408	JERRY	Great word.  Towel?
L327093	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"I got there from ""coin,"" dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan."
L327092	u6136	m408	JERRY	"But how did you get ""kwan?"" _ 82."
L327091	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
L327090	u6136	m408	JERRY	That's your word?
L327089	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	--  the kwan.
L327088	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the ""coin.""  It's the..."
L327087	u6136	m408	JERRY	I understand your anxiety.
L327086	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
L327085	u6136	m408	JERRY	Uh, not today, but --
L327084	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"Did you tell him about the ""ten million for four years?"""
L326989	u6136	m408	JERRY	Oh my God.
L326988	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
L326987	u6136	m408	JERRY	Another drink please.
L326986	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your ""nya nya nya."""
L326985	u6136	m408	JERRY	Why not?
L326984	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You are not allowed to act this way.
L326983	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
L326982	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	No.
L326981	u6136	m408	JERRY	The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
L326980	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
L326979	u6136	m408	JERRY	"See this jacket I'm wearing?  You like it?  I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on ""do not do this"" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!"
L326978	u6136	m408	JERRY	Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
L326977	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Huh?
L326976	u6136	m408	JERRY	What are you doing with me, Rod?
L326975	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
L326974	u6136	m408	JERRY	Rod --
L326972	u6136	m408	JERRY	Very much.
L326971	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You love me now, don't you?
L326889	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I might call you later!
L326888	u6136	m408	JERRY	Call me tomorrow.
L326887	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
L326886	u6136	m408	JERRY	Get some sleep.  See you tomorrow.
L326885	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Good.  I was just testing ya.  But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
L326884	u6136	m408	JERRY	"I'm not about love -- I'm about ""showing you the money."""
L326883	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You're loving me now, aren't ya?
L326881	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Okay, I understand.  I'll boil it down for ya.  Fuck Nike.  All they do is ignore me...
L326880	u6136	m408	JERRY	I gotta get back to Cushman.
L326879	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
L326878	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Let's do it again.
L326877	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
L326876	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
L326868	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
L326867	u6136	m408	JERRY	At last I find you.
L326723	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
L326722	u6136	m408	JERRY	Show.  Me.  The.  Money.
L326721	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
L326720	u6136	m408	JERRY	I got it.
L326719	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"Here it is.  ""Show me the money.""  Show.  Me.  The.  Money. _ 36."
L326718	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yes.
L326717	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
L326716	u6136	m408	JERRY	Mmm.  Hmm.
L326715	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	--  now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
L326710	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Exactly.  And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look!  And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water.  Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
L326709	u6136	m408	JERRY	Now you want Arizona dollars.
L326708	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	"Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain ""get killed, catch the ball."" That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!"
L326707	u6136	m408	JERRY	Okay.
L326706	u6143	m408	TIDWELL	Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
L326572	u6144	m408	WOMAN	Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
L326571	u6136	m408	JERRY	"Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, ""Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me."" And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said ""yes"" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February."
L326567	u6136	m408	JERRY	But wait...
L326566	u6144	m408	WOMAN	How sad --
L326565	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet.  And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know.  And I decide I'm not going to propose.  The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't.  And she knows I know.  So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that.  We fly to Honolulu in silence.  We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
L326564	u6144	m408	WOMAN	Oh no -- _ 14.
L326563	u6136	m408	JERRY	"To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- ""Hurry up, klutz."""
L326562	u6144	m408	WOMAN	To the pools?
L326561	u6136	m408	JERRY	Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
L326560	u6144	m408	WOMAN	That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
L326559	u6136	m408	JERRY	A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
L326558	u6144	m408	WOMAN	Gorgeous.
L326557	u6136	m408	JERRY	--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
L326556	u6144	m408	WOMAN	Oh, tell the story.
L326552	u6136	m408	JERRY	She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
L326551	u6144	m408	WOMAN	Tell me, and then you can sleep.
L326550	u6136	m408	JERRY	I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
L326549	u6144	m408	WOMAN	It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
L326548	u6136	m408	JERRY	I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
L326547	u6144	m408	WOMAN	And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
L326544	u6136	m408	JERRY	Well.  Good luck with that --
L326543	u6144	m408	WOMAN	Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
L326542	u6136	m408	JERRY	Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
L326541	u6144	m408	WOMAN	You're with the sports people on the plane, right?
L326535	u6136	m408	JERRY	Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
L326534	u6144	m408	WOMAN	What --
L326533	u6136	m408	JERRY	I have to ask.
L327432	u6136	m408	JERRY	Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
L327431	u6138	m408	MARCEE	Stay calm?  I'm freakin...
L327430	u6136	m408	JERRY	Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
L327429	u6138	m408	MARCEE	I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
L327428	u6136	m408	JERRY	He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
L327242	u6138	m408	MARCEE	My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
L327241	u6136	m408	JERRY	Don't be silly.
L327240	u6138	m408	MARCEE	I'm sorry what I said back there.
L327220	u6138	m408	MARCEE	What DO you stand for???
L327219	u6136	m408	JERRY	Marcee --
L327218	u6138	m408	MARCEE	"What are you talking about -- ""don't get emotional."" If you ask me, you haven't gotten emotional ENOUGH about this man. _ 98."
L327217	u6136	m408	JERRY	Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
L327214	u6138	m408	MARCEE	"And say what?  ""Please remove your dick from my ass?!"""
L327213	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'll go back to them.
L326654	u6136	m408	JERRY	Damn right.
L326653	u6138	m408	MARCEE	Damn right, and you can start by taking Rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
L326652	u6136	m408	JERRY	Marcee, things are changing around here.  You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
L326651	u6136	m408	JERRY	Not a chance.
L326650	u6138	m408	MARCEE	You gonna get that --
L326643	u6138	m408	MARCEE	I know you say to take the Arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
L326642	u6136	m408	JERRY	How can I make your life better?
L326640	u6138	m408	MARCEE	Jerry, Rod is very very upset. Tyson, no!
L326639	u6136	m408	JERRY	Marcee.  How's my favorite player's wife?
L326684	u6141	m408	SUGAR	I've got the clients.  I've got the juice.
L326683	u6136	m408	JERRY	SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be?  You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone.  You'd be my only client on that team...
L326677	u6141	m408	SUGAR	You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
L326676	u6136	m408	JERRY	-- and I'll get 'em.
L326675	u6141	m408	SUGAR	Jerry --
L326674	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'm over it.  Now I want all my clients and yours too.
L326673	u6141	m408	SUGAR	You wanted smaller.
L326672	u6136	m408	JERRY	You'll lose.
L326671	u6141	m408	SUGAR	Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor!  Can you get past yourself for a second?
L326670	u6136	m408	JERRY	Dick.
L326669	u6141	m408	SUGAR	... dick?
L326666	u6141	m408	SUGAR	"You did this to yourself.  You said ""fewer clients.""  You put it all on paper.  Scully was very upset.  Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  You did this to yourself --"
L326665	u6136	m408	JERRY	You...
L326664	u6141	m408	SUGAR	I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
L326663	u6136	m408	JERRY	Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
L326661	u6141	m408	SUGAR	Came here to fire you, Jerry.
L326660	u6136	m408	JERRY	Pardon me?
L326659	u6141	m408	SUGAR	I came here to let you go. _ 27.
L326658	u6136	m408	JERRY	I'm fine.  What's up?
L326657	u6141	m408	SUGAR	You okay?
L326656	u6136	m408	JERRY	Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
L326646	u6141	m408	SUGAR	Pleasure.
L326645	u6136	m408	JERRY	Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
L326644	u6141	m408	SUGAR	Cronin's okay for lunch?
L326631	u6141	m408	SUGAR	The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
L326630	u6136	m408	JERRY	Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
L327276	u6136	m408	JERRY	It's in a cage.  Do not be scared of...
L327275	u6140	m408	RAY	I'm scared.  What is it?
L327274	u6136	m408	JERRY	-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
L327273	u6136	m408	JERRY	Right up ahead, buddy --
L327272	u6140	m408	RAY	Show me the animal, Jerry!
L327207	u6136	m408	JERRY	A lot.  We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
L327206	u6140	m408	RAY	What's going on, Jerry?
L327048	u6140	m408	RAY	Funny...   I better go to bed.
L327047	u6136	m408	JERRY	Funny.
L327046	u6140	m408	RAY	I don't see any.
L327045	u6136	m408	JERRY	We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
L327044	u6140	m408	RAY	I won't tell.
L327043	u6136	m408	JERRY	Yeah I know.  I did.
L327042	u6140	m408	RAY	"You said ""fuck""."
L327041	u6136	m408	JERRY	Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
L327040	u6140	m408	RAY	Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
L327039	u6136	m408	JERRY	Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
L327038	u6140	m408	RAY	Let's go the zoo.
L327037	u6136	m408	JERRY	Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad.
L327036	u6140	m408	RAY	And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
L327030	u6136	m408	JERRY	Hi Ray.
L327029	u6140	m408	RAY	Hi.
L326843	u6140	m408	RAY	I'm not your brother!
L326842	u6136	m408	JERRY	They do, my brother.
L326841	u6140	m408	RAY	No.
L326840	u6136	m408	JERRY	Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
L326604	u6136	m408	JERRY	Thanks.  May I offer you both a ride?
L326603	u6140	m408	RAY	One-two-three, swing.
L327425	u6142	m408	TEE PEE	I'm not putting him down, I just have a commitment to the truth.
L327424	u6138	m408	MARCEE	Shut up!!!
L327423	u6142	m408	TEE PEE	He should have kept his head tucked down.
L327421	u6142	m408	TEE PEE	What'd I say?
L327420	u6138	m408	MARCEE	Can you be quiet?
L327419	u6142	m408	TEE PEE	He's gonna have nothing left for next season.  They're letting him kill himself.
L327314	u6142	m408	TEE PEE	That's why they cheer, you know. The white man sending the black man into battle...
L327313	u6138	m408	MARCEE	Now go kiss your daddy, quick.
L360177	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
L360176	u6410	m427	MONICA	What are you talking about?
L360109	u6410	m427	MONICA	It mattered, Mom.
L360108	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
L360107	u6410	m427	MONICA	That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
L360103	u6410	m427	MONICA	What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
L360102	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	That's ridiculous.
L360101	u6410	m427	MONICA	I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
L360100	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	I don't remember that.
L360099	u6410	m427	MONICA	I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
L360098	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
L360097	u6410	m427	MONICA	That's not it.
L360096	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
L360095	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
L360094	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
L360093	u6410	m427	MONICA	Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
L360092	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
L360091	u6410	m427	MONICA	I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
L360090	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
L360089	u6410	m427	MONICA	No I don't.
L360088	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
L360087	u6410	m427	MONICA	"So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a ""dumb"" jump shot?"
L360086	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	"What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too ""prissy"" for you, too bad."
L360085	u6410	m427	MONICA	There you go.
L360084	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Don't curse.
L360083	u6410	m427	MONICA	I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
L360082	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
L360081	u6410	m427	MONICA	Whatever.
L360080	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
L360079	u6410	m427	MONICA	So what do I do?
L360077	u6410	m427	MONICA	Maybe she is.
L360076	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
L360075	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah, you met her?
L360074	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	To that stewardess?
L360073	u6410	m427	MONICA	Engaged.
L360072	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	How is he?
L360071	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
L360070	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	I can manage.
L360069	u6410	m427	MONICA	Need any help?
L360068	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Hi.
L359922	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
L359921	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359918	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	He's still at the bank.
L359917	u6410	m427	MONICA	Dad around?
L359916	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
L359915	u6410	m427	MONICA	Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
L359914	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Monica.  What are you doing here?
L359558	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
L359557	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359548	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Nothing.  So good luck.
L359547	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359546	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
L359545	u6410	m427	MONICA	You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
L359544	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Child, take a bite.
L359543	u6410	m427	MONICA	I can't eat before a game.
L359542	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Taste this.
L359400	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Watch your mouth.
L359399	u6410	m427	MONICA	Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
L359398	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	That's not funny
L359397	u6410	m427	MONICA	I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
L359396	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
L359395	u6410	m427	MONICA	nothing.
L359342	u6410	m427	MONICA	Pants.
L359341	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
L359340	u6410	m427	MONICA	I hate it.
L359339	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
L359338	u6410	m427	MONICA	Ah, Mom.
L359332	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Oh, all that work.
L359331	u6410	m427	MONICA	Nothing.
L359330	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Monica, what did you do?
L359350	u6411	m427	NATHAN	Thanks, sweetheart.
L359349	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Okay.
L359348	u6411	m427	NATHAN	You sure?
L359347	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	The blue.
L359346	u6411	m427	NATHAN	Which one for tomorrow?
L359272	u6411	m427	NATHAN	Camille, she'll be fine.
L359271	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	How is she alright looking the way she does?
L359270	u6411	m427	NATHAN	She's alright.
L359269	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
L360173	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Okay.
L360172	u6409	m427	LENA	He's fine.
L360171	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
L360170	u6409	m427	LENA	The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
L360169	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	So you're still breast-feeding?
L359394	u6409	m427	LENA	What'd you do?
L359393	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
L359387	u6409	m427	LENA	But you use potato?
L359386	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
L359345	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
L359344	u6409	m427	LENA	Are you okay?
L359343	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
L359305	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Really?  Well, come on, then.
L359304	u6412	m427	NONA	You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
L359303	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
L359302	u6412	m427	NONA	You're a caterer?
L359301	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
L359300	u6412	m427	NONA	It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
L359299	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
L359298	u6412	m427	NONA	Okay?
L359297	u6404	m427	CAMILLE	Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
L359296	u6412	m427	NONA	...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
L359820	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	You think I'd go hoarse for a player with no potential?   When I ignore you, that's when you worry.  Go get dressed.
L359819	u6410	m427	MONICA	It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
L359818	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	What?
L359816	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	You want the job or not?
L359815	u6410	m427	MONICA	I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
L359814	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
L359813	u6410	m427	MONICA	Thanks.
L359812	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.
L359672	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	I want you to stand like that until you're sick of it because I don't ever want to see it again, you hear me?  Dora, take her spot.
L359671	u6410	m427	MONICA	Coach...
L359670	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
L359669	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359640	u6405	m427	COACH MILLER	This time get your feet set.
L359639	u6410	m427	MONICA	I can take it.
L359604	u6406	m427	JASON	Shh.  It's okay.
L359603	u6410	m427	MONICA	Wait...
L359602	u6406	m427	JASON	Your sister told me hands off, but I can't help myself...
L359601	u6410	m427	MONICA	Uh-huh.
L359600	u6406	m427	JASON	That was nice.
L359586	u6406	m427	JASON	Then I'll get you some punch.
L359585	u6410	m427	MONICA	My mouth is kinda dry.
L359584	u6406	m427	JASON	I mean, I'm having a good time with you...
L359583	u6410	m427	MONICA	Sorry.
L359582	u6406	m427	JASON	That was two words.
L359581	u6410	m427	MONICA	Huh?
L359580	u6406	m427	JASON	Careful.
L359579	u6410	m427	MONICA	Sort of.
L359578	u6406	m427	JASON	I'm an English major.  You like English?
L359564	u6410	m427	MONICA	Oh, sorry.
L359563	u6406	m427	JASON	No, I mean I can check it for you.
L359562	u6410	m427	MONICA	You're cold?
L359561	u6406	m427	JASON	Can I take your coat?
L359426	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
L359425	u6407	m427	JIM	But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
L359424	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Gotta wait til the press conference.
L359423	u6407	m427	JIM	You could make a career by telling me where.
L359422	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
L359421	u6407	m427	JIM	Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
L360127	u6408	m427	KYRA	Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
L360126	u6413	m427	QUINCY	A horse?
L360125	u6408	m427	KYRA	You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
L360124	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I don't know sometimes.
L360123	u6408	m427	KYRA	To do what you love.
L360122	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
L360121	u6408	m427	KYRA	Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's going well.  You'll be back before you know it.
L360120	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You might be the only one with a job.
L360119	u6408	m427	KYRA	Why not?
L360118	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Nah.
L360117	u6408	m427	KYRA	Four days.
L360116	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So how long is this trip?
L360114	u6408	m427	KYRA	Get used to it, babe.
L360113	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I don't wanna see that.
L360112	u6408	m427	KYRA	What?
L360111	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Damn, girl.
L360065	u6408	m427	KYRA	Yes, we appreciate that.
L360064	u6413	m427	QUINCY	It means a lot that you came by.
L360059	u6408	m427	KYRA	Monica.  You grew up together, right? Quincy's told me about you.
L360058	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...
L360057	u6408	m427	KYRA	Hello.
L360055	u6408	m427	KYRA	Why are you up?  Get in bed.
L360054	u6413	m427	QUINCY	It's okay.
L360053	u6408	m427	KYRA	I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
L359539	u6409	m427	LENA	Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
L359538	u6410	m427	MONICA	They ever love you back?
L359537	u6409	m427	LENA	Too many times.
L359536	u6410	m427	MONICA	You ever been in love?
L359535	u6409	m427	LENA	Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
L359534	u6410	m427	MONICA	I don't know how to walk in heels.
L359533	u6409	m427	LENA	If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
L359532	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah, right.
L359531	u6409	m427	LENA	You do.
L359530	u6410	m427	MONICA	Oh, great.
L359529	u6409	m427	LENA	I told him you looked like me.
L359528	u6410	m427	MONICA	How'd you get him to say yes?
L359527	u6409	m427	LENA	And he's fine, girl.
L359526	u6410	m427	MONICA	He's in college?
L359525	u6409	m427	LENA	This brother from my college.
L359524	u6410	m427	MONICA	Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
L359523	u6409	m427	LENA	No.
L359522	u6410	m427	MONICA	Mom tell you to do this?
L359521	u6409	m427	LENA	I know...
L359520	u6410	m427	MONICA	Found?  I'm not some charity case.
L359519	u6409	m427	LENA	I found you someone.
L359518	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
L359517	u6409	m427	LENA	So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
L359515	u6409	m427	LENA	Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
L359514	u6410	m427	MONICA	No one's forcing her.
L359513	u6409	m427	LENA	You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
L359512	u6410	m427	MONICA	Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
L359511	u6409	m427	LENA	Like you don't give her a hard time.
L359510	u6410	m427	MONICA	Always on my ass, anyway.
L359509	u6409	m427	LENA	Mom's going to hate it.
L359508	u6410	m427	MONICA	No.
L359507	u6409	m427	LENA	That too tight?
L360136	u6411	m427	NATHAN	I'll take that as a compliment.
L360135	u6410	m427	MONICA	You shoot like a girl.
L360132	u6411	m427	NATHAN	So how's the job going?
L360131	u6410	m427	MONICA	That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
L360130	u6411	m427	NATHAN	I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been hearing good things about you.
L360129	u6410	m427	MONICA	Dad.  What are you doing here?
L360128	u6411	m427	NATHAN	Hey, munchkin.
L359406	u6410	m427	MONICA	Chances are there's still a chance.
L359405	u6411	m427	NATHAN	I know.  But chances are...
L359404	u6410	m427	MONICA	The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
L359403	u6411	m427	NATHAN	You only have one game left and you haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
L359402	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359401	u6411	m427	NATHAN	Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
L359392	u6410	m427	MONICA	I was just showing emotion.
L359391	u6411	m427	NATHAN	You lost your head.
L359390	u6410	m427	MONICA	The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
L359389	u6411	m427	NATHAN	And what am I supposed to say to the man?
L359388	u6410	m427	MONICA	Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
L359987	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
L359986	u6410	m427	MONICA	You ever think about going back?
L359985	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
L359984	u6410	m427	MONICA	Just not my type, I guess.
L359983	u6415	m427	SIDRA	What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
L359982	u6410	m427	MONICA	I wouldn't know.
L359981	u6415	m427	SIDRA	So what are these Spanish guys like?
L359979	u6415	m427	SIDRA	"It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad ""The American"" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball."
L359978	u6410	m427	MONICA	How's that been?
L359977	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
L359976	u6410	m427	MONICA	Just like that?
L359975	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
L359972	u6410	m427	MONICA	You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
L359971	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Can you take that damn thing off the table.
L359970	u6410	m427	MONICA	"How do you say ""you're dreaming"" in Italian?"
L359969	u6415	m427	SIDRA	I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
L359968	u6410	m427	MONICA	What's up, Sidra.
L359967	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Well, what do you know.
L359860	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Never let a freshman take your spot.
L359859	u6410	m427	MONICA	What's that?
L359858	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Just one word of advice for next season.
L359857	u6410	m427	MONICA	I know.
L359856	u6415	m427	SIDRA	But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
L359855	u6410	m427	MONICA	Thanks.
L359854	u6415	m427	SIDRA	No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
L359853	u6410	m427	MONICA	But?
L359852	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Just wanted to say good game.
L359851	u6410	m427	MONICA	What's up?
L359682	u6410	m427	MONICA	Didn't have to try very hard.
L359681	u6415	m427	SIDRA	You were trying to make me look bad.
L359680	u6410	m427	MONICA	I was just playing ball.
L359679	u6415	m427	SIDRA	That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
L359647	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
L359646	u6410	m427	MONICA	Thanks, Sidra.
L359645	u6415	m427	SIDRA	Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
L359644	u6410	m427	MONICA	What's up with that?
L359643	u6415	m427	SIDRA	She hates all freshmen.
L359642	u6410	m427	MONICA	Coach hates me, doesn't she?
L360211	u6410	m427	MONICA	If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
L360210	u6413	m427	QUINCY	And what happens when you lose?
L360209	u6410	m427	MONICA	So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
L360208	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So?
L360207	u6410	m427	MONICA	You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
L360206	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What will this prove?
L360204	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
L360203	u6410	m427	MONICA	I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
L360202	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What's that supposed to be, psychology?
L360201	u6410	m427	MONICA	So you're gonna bitch up?
L360200	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You're out of your mind.
L360199	u6410	m427	MONICA	Your heart.
L360198	u6413	m427	QUINCY	For what?
L360197	u6410	m427	MONICA	One game.  One-on-one.
L360196	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What?
L360195	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'll play you.
L360194	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Wrong.
L360193	u6410	m427	MONICA	Better late than never, right?
L360192	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
L360191	u6410	m427	MONICA	Then why are you so upset?
L360190	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
L360189	u6410	m427	MONICA	I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
L360188	u6413	m427	QUINCY	We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
L360187	u6410	m427	MONICA	What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
L360186	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I heard enough.
L360185	u6410	m427	MONICA	It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
L360184	u6413	m427	QUINCY	you woke me up to tell me that?
L360183	u6410	m427	MONICA	From basketball.
L360182	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What?
L360181	u6410	m427	MONICA	You asked me what was missing.
L360179	u6410	m427	MONICA	We need to talk.
L360178	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What's going on?
L360168	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Find.
L360167	u6410	m427	MONICA	It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
L360166	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What?
L360165	u6410	m427	MONICA	Something was just missing.
L360164	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Cause I don't get it.
L360163	u6410	m427	MONICA	Why do you keep asking me that?
L360162	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So why'd you give up ball?
L360161	u6410	m427	MONICA	It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
L360160	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet.  She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
L360159	u6410	m427	MONICA	Wow.
L360158	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Maybe go back to school.
L360157	u6410	m427	MONICA	Like what?
L360156	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
L360155	u6410	m427	MONICA	You're serious.
L360154	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
L360153	u6410	m427	MONICA	And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
L360152	u6413	m427	QUINCY	That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
L360151	u6410	m427	MONICA	You had a rough couple years, that's all.
L360150	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
L360149	u6410	m427	MONICA	It just isn't.
L360147	u6410	m427	MONICA	That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
L360146	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
L360145	u6410	m427	MONICA	Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
L360144	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Getting there.
L360143	u6410	m427	MONICA	So...how's the knee?
L360142	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
L360141	u6410	m427	MONICA	Who's this guy I always see her around?
L360140	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Kyra's gone for a couple days.  Figured I'd keep Mom company.
L360139	u6410	m427	MONICA	You visiting?
L360067	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Thanks.
L360066	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
L360051	u6413	m427	QUINCY	No.
L360050	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
L360049	u6413	m427	QUINCY	A rest?
L360048	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
L360047	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What do you mean?
L360046	u6410	m427	MONICA	Actually, I don't...
L360045	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Figured it was something like that.
L360044	u6410	m427	MONICA	Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
L360043	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American.  And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
L360042	u6410	m427	MONICA	Oh yeah?
L360041	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Tried calling you a couple times.
L360040	u6410	m427	MONICA	Kiss my ass.
L360039	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Funny.  I never did.
L360038	u6410	m427	MONICA	Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
L360037	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
L360036	u6410	m427	MONICA	We won the championship.
L360035	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
L360034	u6410	m427	MONICA	"I forgot, ""Q-man."""
L360033	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Not for Quincy McCall.
L360032	u6410	m427	MONICA	I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
L360031	u6413	m427	QUINCY	A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be back in six months.
L360030	u6410	m427	MONICA	What are the doctors saying?
L360029	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yup.
L360028	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
L360027	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'm alright.  But you can sit.
L360026	u6410	m427	MONICA	Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
L360025	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Thanks.
L360024	u6410	m427	MONICA	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
L360023	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Just something I'm trying.
L360022	u6410	m427	MONICA	I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
L360021	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.
L359956	u6410	m427	MONICA	Uh huh.
L359955	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So...I guess I'll see you around.
L359953	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
L359952	u6410	m427	MONICA	So that's it, just forget about us?
L359951	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Few days ago.
L359950	u6410	m427	MONICA	When did you decide all this?
L359949	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
L359948	u6410	m427	MONICA	You're what?
L359947	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Look, I'm entering the draft.
L359946	u6410	m427	MONICA	You don't think so?
L359945	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I don't think so.
L359944	u6410	m427	MONICA	How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
L359943	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
L359942	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359941	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'm not asking for us to be together.
L359940	u6410	m427	MONICA	How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
L359939	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
L359938	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
L359937	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Never had to.
L359936	u6410	m427	MONICA	I never asked you to choose.
L359935	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Least you got your priorities straight.
L359934	u6410	m427	MONICA	If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
L359933	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Stay!
L359932	u6410	m427	MONICA	That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
L359931	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You forgot to be there.
L359930	u6410	m427	MONICA	"What, ""Q-man"", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?"
L359929	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
L359928	u6410	m427	MONICA	So you fucked around to prove a point!
L359927	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Least she had time for me.
L359926	u6410	m427	MONICA	Cheap date.
L359925	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
L359924	u6410	m427	MONICA	Talk to your new girlfriend.
L359923	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Can we talk?
L359911	u6410	m427	MONICA	Are you out of your mind?
L359910	u6413	m427	QUINCY	We're going to get some food.
L359909	u6410	m427	MONICA	What the hell's going on?
L359908	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica, Kerry.
L359905	u6410	m427	MONICA	Woman...
L359904	u6413	m427	QUINCY	"The ""man"" again."
L359903	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
L359902	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
L359901	u6410	m427	MONICA	You weren't at my game.
L359900	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Hey, what's up.
L359899	u6410	m427	MONICA	Hey.
L359878	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Nah.  I have curfew.
L359877	u6410	m427	MONICA	Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
L359876	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
L359873	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Not really.
L359872	u6410	m427	MONICA	You want to go talk?
L359871	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
L359870	u6410	m427	MONICA	Who's nobody?
L359869	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Nobody.
L359868	u6410	m427	MONICA	Who was that?
L359846	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
L359845	u6410	m427	MONICA	he's just playing, Q...
L359835	u6413	m427	QUINCY	It happens, right...
L359834	u6410	m427	MONICA	Sorry about your game.
L359833	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Here I am.
L359832	u6410	m427	MONICA	I've been trying to find you all day.
L359831	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What's up?
L359830	u6410	m427	MONICA	Hey.
L359785	u6413	m427	QUINCY	For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
L359784	u6410	m427	MONICA	Quincy...
L359783	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Nah.  Don't sweat it.
L359782	u6410	m427	MONICA	I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
L359781	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
L359780	u6410	m427	MONICA	Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
L359779	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Why not?
L359778	u6410	m427	MONICA	I...can't.
L359777	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
L359776	u6410	m427	MONICA	Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
L359775	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
L359774	u6410	m427	MONICA	You're not stupid.
L359773	u6413	m427	QUINCY	"He even had me wanting to play for the ""Clippers.""  Man, how stupid am I."
L359772	u6410	m427	MONICA	She understands.
L359771	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
L359770	u6410	m427	MONICA	I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
L359769	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
L359714	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I wanted you to.
L359713	u6410	m427	MONICA	I won.
L359712	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Right here.
L359711	u6410	m427	MONICA	"Yo, where's the ""D""?"
L359708	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Plan to.
L359707	u6410	m427	MONICA	Kiss my booty.
L359706	u6413	m427	QUINCY	My court, I go first.
L359705	u6410	m427	MONICA	Give me the ball.
L359703	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359702	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Clothes.
L359701	u6410	m427	MONICA	What are we playing for?
L359700	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So how about a little one-on-one?
L359698	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
L359697	u6410	m427	MONICA	That was so weak.
L359694	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So you're gonna act salty all night?
L359693	u6410	m427	MONICA	I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
L359692	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Then prove her wrong.
L359691	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
L359690	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Forget Tonya Randall.
L359663	u6410	m427	MONICA	Quit.
L359662	u6413	m427	QUINCY	It's okay, little baby.
L359661	u6410	m427	MONICA	I said fine.
L359660	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I can't help girls coming up to me.
L359659	u6410	m427	MONICA	Fine, Quincy.
L359658	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I can't be nice to a fan?
L359657	u6410	m427	MONICA	You do see me standing here, right?
L359656	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What?
L359652	u6410	m427	MONICA	Whatever, big head.
L359651	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
L359650	u6410	m427	MONICA	What'd it say?
L359649	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yeah.
L359648	u6410	m427	MONICA	You finish the reading for E-con?
L359626	u6410	m427	MONICA	I know, right?
L359625	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What was that about?
L359623	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You sure?
L359622	u6410	m427	MONICA	It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
L359621	u6413	m427	QUINCY	When'd you get this?
L359619	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You had four offensive rebounds.
L359618	u6410	m427	MONICA	What?
L359617	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Four.
L359615	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
L359614	u6410	m427	MONICA	Why?
L359613	u6413	m427	QUINCY	That what you think?
L359612	u6410	m427	MONICA	Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
L359611	u6413	m427	QUINCY	None of your business.
L359610	u6410	m427	MONICA	So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
L359609	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Figures.
L359608	u6410	m427	MONICA	Mulholland Drive.
L359607	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
L359606	u6410	m427	MONICA	Early night for you, isn't it?
L359594	u6410	m427	MONICA	So you took Shawnee, huh?
L359593	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Guess not.
L359592	u6410	m427	MONICA	He ain't Spalding.
L359591	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
L359590	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah.
L359589	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You having fun?
L359588	u6410	m427	MONICA	Hey.
L359587	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Hey.
L359571	u6410	m427	MONICA	You either.
L359570	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You don't look half-bad.
L359569	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah.
L359568	u6413	m427	QUINCY	See you made it.
L359475	u6410	m427	MONICA	Good.
L359474	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I don't.
L359473	u6410	m427	MONICA	Didn't know you cared so much.
L359472	u6413	m427	QUINCY	With a jacked-up attitude.
L359471	u6410	m427	MONICA	"Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a ""lady"".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player."
L359470	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
L359469	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
L359468	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
L359467	u6410	m427	MONICA	Would you watch the damn road?
L359466	u6413	m427	QUINCY	That's it, give it your best shot.
L359465	u6410	m427	MONICA	When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
L359464	u6413	m427	QUINCY	God, here we go.
L359463	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm not the one who put this scar here.
L359462	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Your hot-ass temper.
L359461	u6410	m427	MONICA	Who said I'm not getting recruited?
L359460	u6413	m427	QUINCY	See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
L359459	u6410	m427	MONICA	Who's Spalding?
L359458	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
L359457	u6410	m427	MONICA	I don't.
L359456	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Didn't know you cared so much.
L359455	u6410	m427	MONICA	Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
L359454	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So she's honest.
L359453	u6410	m427	MONICA	"And?  She's not saying, ""I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better,"" she's saying, ""I wanna bone."""
L359452	u6413	m427	QUINCY	And?
L359451	u6410	m427	MONICA	She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
L359450	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
L359448	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Big-ass titties?
L359447	u6410	m427	MONICA	Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
L359446	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What's that?
L359445	u6410	m427	MONICA	Please.
L359444	u6413	m427	QUINCY	"Guess ""please"" would be a stretch."
L359443	u6410	m427	MONICA	Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
L359442	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Your legs don't look broke.
L359441	u6410	m427	MONICA	A ride home.
L359440	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I know this.  What do you want?
L359439	u6410	m427	MONICA	Way to hoop.
L359373	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Shut up!
L359372	u6410	m427	MONICA	Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
L359371	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What?
L359370	u6410	m427	MONICA	You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
L359369	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Man, forget you then, stupid.
L359368	u6410	m427	MONICA	I don't have to do what you say.
L359367	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So that means I have to ride with you.
L359366	u6410	m427	MONICA	So?
L359365	u6413	m427	QUINCY	My Dad always drives my Mom.
L359364	u6410	m427	MONICA	I want to ride my own bike.
L359363	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Five seconds.
L359362	u6410	m427	MONICA	For how long?
L359361	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I think we gotta kiss now.
L359360	u6410	m427	MONICA	Okay.
L359359	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Kay.
L359358	u6410	m427	MONICA	How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
L359357	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Oh.
L359356	u6410	m427	MONICA	I don't like flowers.
L359355	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
L359354	u6410	m427	MONICA	What do I have to do?
L359327	u6413	m427	QUINCY	She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
L359326	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
L359325	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
L359324	u6410	m427	MONICA	I don't care.
L359323	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You do act different.
L359322	u6410	m427	MONICA	One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
L359321	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I don't know.  A lot.
L359320	u6410	m427	MONICA	What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
L359319	u6413	m427	QUINCY	He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
L359318	u6410	m427	MONICA	I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
L359317	u6413	m427	QUINCY	"My Dad plays for the ""Clippers.""  He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too.  Same number and everything."
L359316	u6410	m427	MONICA	He works at a bank.
L359315	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Your Dad play?
L359314	u6410	m427	MONICA	My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
L359313	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I never knew a girl that could play.
L359312	u6410	m427	MONICA	I just can.
L359311	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So how come you could play basketball?
L359310	u6410	m427	MONICA	Uh huh.
L359309	u6413	m427	QUINCY	For real?
L359308	u6410	m427	MONICA	It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
L359307	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So...does it hurt?
L359265	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
L359264	u6410	m427	MONICA	Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
L359259	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Lucky.
L359258	u6410	m427	MONICA	One, up.
L359420	u6414	m427	SHAWNEE	I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
L359419	u6410	m427	MONICA	Give it yourself.
L359418	u6414	m427	SHAWNEE	Well, can you give him this for me?
L359417	u6410	m427	MONICA	There's so many I just can't keep track.
L359416	u6414	m427	SHAWNEE	C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
L359415	u6410	m427	MONICA	No.
L359414	u6414	m427	SHAWNEE	Your hair looks so cute like that.
L359413	u6410	m427	MONICA	Hey.
L359412	u6414	m427	SHAWNEE	Hey, girl.
L360000	u6412	m427	NONA	Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
L359999	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
L359998	u6412	m427	NONA	He tore his ACL.
L359997	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Nona, please.
L359996	u6412	m427	NONA	The doctor'll be back in a minute.
L359995	u6416	m427	ZEKE	What's that, not great?
L359994	u6412	m427	NONA	Not great.
L359505	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Keep your voice down.
L359504	u6412	m427	NONA	Fine, then how many nights home is that?
L359503	u6416	m427	ZEKE	"No, you said I should get my degree.  I like my ""bullshit"" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold."
L359502	u6412	m427	NONA	You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
L359501	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I have.
L359500	u6412	m427	NONA	I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
L359499	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Yeah.
L359498	u6412	m427	NONA	I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
L359497	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
L359496	u6412	m427	NONA	At one in the morning?
L359495	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I had some players to see and hands to shake.
L359291	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe two years left to play.  I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
L359290	u6412	m427	NONA	You just got back from a four game road trip.
L359289	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Business folks.
L359288	u6412	m427	NONA	With who?
L359287	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a meeting.
L359286	u6412	m427	NONA	We should head over.
L359285	u6416	m427	ZEKE	"What?  Oh, and, uh, don't say ""shit."""
L359284	u6412	m427	NONA	Zeke.
L359767	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
L359766	u6412	m427	NONA	Guess I should have been telling your father.
L359765	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
L359764	u6412	m427	NONA	Quincy, please...
L359763	u6413	m427	QUINCY	This is just about money, you know that.
L359762	u6412	m427	NONA	Just...leave it alone.
L359761	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
L359760	u6412	m427	NONA	Whose truth are you talking about?
L359759	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
L359758	u6412	m427	NONA	Guess he talked to you.
L359756	u6412	m427	NONA	I'm fine.
L359755	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Sorry.  You okay?
L359754	u6412	m427	NONA	You scared me.
L359494	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
L359493	u6412	m427	NONA	Later when?
L359492	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Said he'd be home later.
L359491	u6412	m427	NONA	Where's your dad?
L359490	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yup.
L359489	u6412	m427	NONA	Still the man.
L359488	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
L359487	u6412	m427	NONA	How was your game?
L359486	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I've been hearing you.
L359485	u6412	m427	NONA	You hearing me?
L359484	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Okay.
L359483	u6412	m427	NONA	I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
L359482	u6413	m427	QUINCY	We were just studying.
L359481	u6412	m427	NONA	Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
L359480	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What are you doing in my room?
L359479	u6412	m427	NONA	I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
L359478	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Uh, your earring?
L359477	u6412	m427	NONA	What is this?
L359295	u6412	m427	NONA	Yeah.
L359294	u6413	m427	QUINCY	We still have to go?
L359293	u6412	m427	NONA	What?
L360015	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
L360014	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yeah.
L360013	u6416	m427	ZEKE	You want me to fuck off?
L360012	u6413	m427	QUINCY	"And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  ""I told you so?"""
L360011	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Quincy.  I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
L360010	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Good.
L360009	u6416	m427	ZEKE	No.
L360008	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
L360007	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I can see that.  I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
L360006	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Look, I'm busy.
L360005	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
L360004	u6413	m427	QUINCY	After five years.
L360003	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Came by to check on you.
L360002	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What do you want?
L359897	u6413	m427	QUINCY	"Always thought ""can't"" wasn't in a man's vocabulary."
L359896	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
L359895	u6413	m427	QUINCY	From your mouth.
L359894	u6416	m427	ZEKE	What?
L359893	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
L359892	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
L359891	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
L359890	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
L359889	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I ain't a damn liar.
L359888	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
L359887	u6413	m427	QUINCY	And some things should never fucking happen!
L359886	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
L359885	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Lucky kid.
L359884	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
L359883	u6413	m427	QUINCY	We ain't got nothing to talk about.
L359882	u6416	m427	ZEKE	We need to talk.
L359881	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Still is, so let yourself out.
L359880	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Your door was unlocked.
L359879	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What are you doing here?
L359750	u6416	m427	ZEKE	We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
L359749	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What's Mom think?
L359748	u6416	m427	ZEKE	"A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the ""Clips.""  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me."
L359747	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Why?
L359746	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
L359745	u6413	m427	QUINCY	So what are you gonna do?
L359744	u6416	m427	ZEKE	No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
L359743	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Sorry.
L359741	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I mean, it's not true, is it?
L359740	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I just told you.
L359739	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Tell me what?
L359738	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
L359737	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What?
L359736	u6416	m427	ZEKE	there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
L359735	u6413	m427	QUINCY	What mess?
L359734	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
L359733	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Okay...
L359732	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
L359731	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You came out early.
L359730	u6416	m427	ZEKE	You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA?  Give yourself time to develop, Quincy.  Get an education.  The NBA ain't going nowhere.
L359729	u6413	m427	QUINCY	I'm also good enough to go pro.
L359728	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
L359727	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You know, people.
L359726	u6416	m427	ZEKE	What people?
L359436	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
L359435	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You work too hard, Pop.
L359434	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
L359433	u6413	m427	QUINCY	You don't wanna hurt your back.
L359432	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
L359431	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
L359429	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Didn't we already have this conversation?
L359428	u6416	m427	ZEKE	I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
L359427	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
L359283	u6416	m427	ZEKE	That's right.
L359282	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
L359281	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Why not?
L359280	u6413	m427	QUINCY	Can't should never be in a man's vocabulary.
L359279	u6416	m427	ZEKE	Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
L449774	u7123	m477	UTAH	I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
L449773	u7118	m477	BODHI	You never were...
L449772	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm not FBI anymore.
L449771	u7118	m477	BODHI	And I always knew I could count on you, Agent Utah.
L449758	u7123	m477	UTAH	Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
L449757	u7118	m477	BODHI	Wild ride, huh?
L449756	u7123	m477	UTAH	SHIT!!
L449755	u7118	m477	BODHI	Three seconds... two... one...
L449753	u7118	m477	BODHI	Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
L449752	u7123	m477	UTAH	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
L449751	u7118	m477	BODHI	Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
L449750	u7118	m477	BODHI	Naw, you pull it!
L449749	u7123	m477	UTAH	No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
L449748	u7118	m477	BODHI	Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
L449741	u7123	m477	UTAH	What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
L449740	u7118	m477	BODHI	Why should I?
L449713	u7123	m477	UTAH	The guy you killed was an off duty cop!  If you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  They have a new thing called radar. Maybe you've heard of it.
L449712	u7118	m477	BODHI	I say when it's over!
L449711	u7123	m477	UTAH	Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
L449710	u7118	m477	BODHI	And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
L449709	u7123	m477	UTAH	You gotta tell me where she is.
L449708	u7118	m477	BODHI	Around somewhere.  Listen, I'm in kind of a hurry, Johnny U.  What can I do for you?
L449707	u7123	m477	UTAH	Where's Roach?
L449706	u7123	m477	UTAH	Good guess.  There's a gun on you right now.
L449705	u7118	m477	BODHI	But you're not alone.
L449704	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm not armed.
L449665	u7118	m477	BODHI	Wild, ain't it?!  See, we exist on a higher plane, you and I.  We make our own rules.  Why be a servant of the law Johnny U... when you can be it's master?
L449664	u7123	m477	UTAH	Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
L449663	u7118	m477	BODHI	Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
L449662	u7123	m477	UTAH	I can't do this.
L449654	u7118	m477	BODHI	See!  That's what I like about you, man!  You're just sharp as a razor blade.
L449653	u7123	m477	UTAH	We're wasting time.
L449651	u7118	m477	BODHI	Sorry, can't do it, brah.  He's on the road.  And where they're going there's no phones.  Damn, I hate this Johnny, I really do.  I hate violence.  See, that's why I need Rosie.  I could never make this thing work, myself.  No way I could hold a knife to Tyler's throat, man! She was my woman, once.  We shared time in this world.  But Rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  Once you set him in motion, he won't stop. That's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  Noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  Nothing I can do, unless I get there.
L449650	u7123	m477	UTAH	You call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
L449649	u7118	m477	BODHI	She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
L449648	u7123	m477	UTAH	Talk.
L449647	u7118	m477	BODHI	Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
L449646	u7123	m477	UTAH	You're a fucking dead man--
L449644	u7118	m477	BODHI	Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
L449643	u7123	m477	UTAH	What's this?
L449639	u7118	m477	BODHI	Okay!
L449638	u7123	m477	UTAH	You first!
L449637	u7118	m477	BODHI	One thousand feet.  Pull the goddamn cord!
L449636	u7123	m477	UTAH	You do it... you first!
L449635	u7118	m477	BODHI	Don't screw around man, pull it!
L449634	u7123	m477	UTAH	After you, Alfonse.  I insist!
L449633	u7118	m477	BODHI	You gonna pull?
L449624	u7118	m477	BODHI	I'll take that as a yes.
L449623	u7123	m477	UTAH	Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
L449622	u7118	m477	BODHI	Utah, you copy bruddah?
L449621	u7118	m477	BODHI	My man!
L449620	u7123	m477	UTAH	We gonna jump or jerk off?
L449617	u7118	m477	BODHI	Then we'll earn it together.  Here, take mine.
L449616	u7123	m477	UTAH	You gotta earn trust.
L449615	u7118	m477	BODHI	I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
L449614	u7123	m477	UTAH	So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
L449613	u7118	m477	BODHI	It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
L449611	u7118	m477	BODHI	Yeah, I noticed you limping.  But don't worry about it, brah. Don't worry at all.  We're not gonna land on land!
L449610	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sure, it's a blast, but listen, I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
L449609	u7118	m477	BODHI	Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
L449608	u7123	m477	UTAH	Once.
L449607	u7118	m477	BODHI	Ever done this before?
L449603	u7118	m477	BODHI	'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
L449602	u7123	m477	UTAH	One shot stopping.
L449597	u7118	m477	BODHI	News, last night... those guys, the Ex-Presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  And I was just there the day before, cashing a check.  See... look.  Assured Trust... same place.
L449596	u7123	m477	UTAH	How you figure?
L449441	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
L449440	u7118	m477	BODHI	The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
L449439	u7123	m477	UTAH	A flaw I'm working on.
L449438	u7118	m477	BODHI	I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
L449437	u7123	m477	UTAH	I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
L449436	u7118	m477	BODHI	Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
L449435	u7118	m477	BODHI	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
L449434	u7123	m477	UTAH	I gotta be fucking crazy.
L449412	u7118	m477	BODHI	No, Bells Beach, Australia.
L449411	u7123	m477	UTAH	So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
L449396	u7118	m477	BODHI	Only make bets I can't afford to lose.  Only way to be 100% committed.
L449395	u7123	m477	UTAH	Don't you gamble?
L449378	u7118	m477	BODHI	Come with Tyler.  She knows.
L449377	u7123	m477	UTAH	Where?
L449376	u7123	m477	UTAH	Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
L449375	u7118	m477	BODHI	De nada.
L449374	u7123	m477	UTAH	Thanks for stepping in.
L449373	u7118	m477	BODHI	No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
L449372	u7123	m477	UTAH	You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
L449371	u7118	m477	BODHI	They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
L449370	u7123	m477	UTAH	What's their program?
L449369	u7118	m477	BODHI	The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
L449368	u7123	m477	UTAH	Friends of yours, huh?
L449305	u7123	m477	UTAH	Not yet.
L449304	u7118	m477	BODHI	Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
L449303	u7123	m477	UTAH	Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
L449302	u7118	m477	BODHI	And that's why you never went pro?
L449301	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
L449300	u7118	m477	BODHI	Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
L449478	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	There's nobody else here...
L449477	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
L449476	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
L449475	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
L449468	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	No.
L449467	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
L449466	u7119	m477	FIBERGLASS	Yeah?  What?
L449695	u7123	m477	UTAH	Take your hand off my shoulder right now.
L449694	u7120	m477	HARP	Three men dead.  One of them a cop. How's that sit in your gut, Utah?
L449318	u7123	m477	UTAH	Caught my first tube this morning.
L449317	u7120	m477	HARP	Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
L449315	u7123	m477	UTAH	The correct term is babes, sir.  Uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  Otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. Of the social infrastructure, I mean.
L449314	u7120	m477	HARP	What?
L449313	u7123	m477	UTAH	Babes.
L449312	u7120	m477	HARP	A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
L449311	u7123	m477	UTAH	A little mushy.
L449310	u7120	m477	HARP	Surf conditions okay?
L449309	u7123	m477	UTAH	Fine.
L449308	u7120	m477	HARP	How was the beach?
L449150	u7123	m477	UTAH	Not so far.
L449149	u7120	m477	HARP	You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
L449147	u7123	m477	UTAH	Zero distortion, sir.
L449146	u7120	m477	HARP	That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
L449145	u7123	m477	UTAH	1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
L449144	u7120	m477	HARP	This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
L449143	u7123	m477	UTAH	I take the skin off chicken.
L449142	u7120	m477	HARP	All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
L449141	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sir?
L449140	u7120	m477	HARP	Eating solid breakfasts, Utah?
L449139	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yes, sir.
L449138	u7120	m477	HARP	You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
L449699	u7120	m477	HARP	What that?
L449698	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
L449697	u7120	m477	HARP	Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
L449696	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
L449194	u7120	m477	HARP	Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
L449193	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
L449192	u7120	m477	HARP	That's the point, isn't it?
L449191	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Cole and Munoz?  I been on this case for two years.
L449190	u7120	m477	HARP	Cole and Munoz.  I'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
L449189	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
L449188	u7120	m477	HARP	They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
L449721	u7123	m477	UTAH	NOOO!!
L449720	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Kid, get outta the way!!
L449719	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo!  Don't fire!
L449702	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Figured you did.
L449701	u7123	m477	UTAH	I know where they're going.
L449561	u7123	m477	UTAH	Nothing.
L449560	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Nothing?
L449547	u7123	m477	UTAH	You sure?!
L449546	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	They took a left at the next light!
L449545	u7123	m477	UTAH	The hell are they?!
L449536	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	That place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  Get me two.
L449535	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
L449534	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Time for lunch.
L449533	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
L449532	u7123	m477	UTAH	I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
L449531	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
L449530	u7123	m477	UTAH	I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
L449528	u7123	m477	UTAH	No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
L449527	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	They're on their way to Maui.
L449523	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
L449522	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
L449521	u7123	m477	UTAH	Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
L449520	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah, or cashing a check.
L449519	u7123	m477	UTAH	Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
L449518	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Did he rob it?
L449517	u7123	m477	UTAH	Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
L449516	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	This Zen master surfer.
L449515	u7123	m477	UTAH	... so I started tailing him.
L449512	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, we gotta talk.
L449511	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
L449498	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Nice tattoo, Dietz.
L449497	u7123	m477	UTAH	Aw shit.
L449464	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
L449463	u7123	m477	UTAH	Got it.
L449462	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
L449461	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm ready to rock, Angelo.  Where you want me?
L449459	u7123	m477	UTAH	Right here, partner.
L449458	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
L449391	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
L449390	u7123	m477	UTAH	When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
L449385	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
L449384	u7123	m477	UTAH	... Felony B and E, three months in juvey.  Better.  Felony assault. Postgraduate work at Chino. Excellent.  I'm lovin' it.  What about the brother?  Great!  Another model citizen. These guys really fit the profile.
L449382	u7123	m477	UTAH	Okay, Dad.
L449381	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
L449367	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Thanks, buddy.
L449366	u7123	m477	UTAH	No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
L449345	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
L449344	u7123	m477	UTAH	Big zippo so far.  How about you?
L449329	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	No.  But let's do it, anyway.  It's gonna bug the shit out of Harp.
L449328	u7123	m477	UTAH	The beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  And surfers are territorial.  They stick mostly to certain breaks.  If we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf. You buyin' this?
L449327	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
L449326	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
L449321	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
L449320	u7123	m477	UTAH	It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
L449319	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	What, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
L449235	u7123	m477	UTAH	Got it...
L449234	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	I think you gotta hit them straight on!
L449233	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
L449232	u7123	m477	UTAH	Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
L449231	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	They're like some kind of tribe. Got their own language.  You can't just walk up to these guys.  You've got to get out there.  Learn some moves.  Get into their head.  Pick up the speech.
L449229	u7123	m477	UTAH	Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
L449228	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Johnny, it's the only way.
L449221	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
L449220	u7123	m477	UTAH	... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
L449218	u7123	m477	UTAH	Thanks for the tip.  I needed this knowledge.
L449217	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
L449216	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
L449215	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
L449214	u7123	m477	UTAH	Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
L449213	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
L449212	u7123	m477	UTAH	Oh well he must be a surfer.
L449210	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	The fucking punks are surfers.
L449209	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah.  What's your theory?
L449208	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Yeah.  That was thirty years ago anyway.  L.A.'s changed a lot since then. The air got dirty and the sex got clean.  So you want to nail the Ex- Presidents?  Be a big hero?
L449207	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sorry.
L449206	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	You watch your fucking mouth!  Mr. Hoover himself pinned the Seal of Honor right here!
L449205	u7123	m477	UTAH	So you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
L449204	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Forget about it, kid.  They're ghosts.  Let the goddamn yuppie Mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  See I'm almost 55... so I must be senile, right?  They better get me out before I start pissing myself in public.  Drooling. It would look bad for the Bureau, right?
L449203	u7123	m477	UTAH	Well, what're your ideas on these guys?
L449202	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	You through, Mr. Wizard?  Let me know if you find Jimmy Hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  Hell, it's only 7:30.  The night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
L449182	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
L449181	u7123	m477	UTAH	Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
L449180	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
L449179	u7123	m477	UTAH	Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
L449178	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
L449177	u7123	m477	UTAH	They don't go for the vault?
L449176	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
L449175	u7123	m477	UTAH	Good move.
L449164	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Welcome to Sea World, kid.
L449163	u7123	m477	UTAH	Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
L449162	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
L449159	u7123	m477	UTAH	The shit they pull, huh?
L449158	u7121	m477	PAPPAS	Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
L449583	u7122	m477	TYLER	Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
L449582	u7123	m477	UTAH	I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
L449580	u7122	m477	TYLER	You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  DID THEY?!
L449579	u7123	m477	UTAH	Tyler, put the gun down.
L449578	u7122	m477	TYLER	Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me!  Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
L449572	u7122	m477	TYLER	But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
L449571	u7123	m477	UTAH	Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
L449570	u7122	m477	TYLER	So what'd the other guy look like?
L449569	u7123	m477	UTAH	You're kneeling on my hand.
L449568	u7122	m477	TYLER	Betadyne doesn't hurt.
L449567	u7123	m477	UTAH	Ouch.
L449508	u7123	m477	UTAH	No.  I'm sorry.  I have to go. I'll, uh... I'll call you later. I'm sorry.
L449507	u7122	m477	TYLER	Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
L449506	u7123	m477	UTAH	I... I gotta go.
L449454	u7123	m477	UTAH	Warm them up.
L449453	u7122	m477	TYLER	Those are cold.
L449451	u7122	m477	TYLER	You don't have to.
L449450	u7123	m477	UTAH	I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
L449449	u7122	m477	TYLER	Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
L449448	u7123	m477	UTAH	What?
L449447	u7122	m477	TYLER	Look at you.
L449446	u7123	m477	UTAH	Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
L449445	u7122	m477	TYLER	You had enough?
L449433	u7122	m477	TYLER	Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
L449432	u7123	m477	UTAH	I can barely do this in broad daylight.
L449429	u7122	m477	TYLER	Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
L449428	u7123	m477	UTAH	What's goin' on?
L449424	u7122	m477	TYLER	I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny.  You've got it.  And Bodhi can smell it a mile away.  He'll take you to the edge... and past it.  Hey, Bodhi.
L449423	u7123	m477	UTAH	What are you talking about?
L449422	u7122	m477	TYLER	Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
L449404	u7122	m477	TYLER	Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  Maybe he has.  You've seen him surf... that frenzy.  It seems like anger.  It's not.  It's the energy of lovemaking.  The sea is the woman in his life.  She's his only true lover.
L449403	u7123	m477	UTAH	"Sure, he's ""the Bodhisattva""."
L449402	u7122	m477	TYLER	We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
L449401	u7123	m477	UTAH	Meaning you were expendable.
L449400	u7122	m477	TYLER	People are expendable to Bodhi.
L449399	u7123	m477	UTAH	Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
L449398	u7122	m477	TYLER	Catch of the day.
L449397	u7123	m477	UTAH	Who's the girl?
L449393	u7122	m477	TYLER	He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
L449392	u7123	m477	UTAH	Nice place.
L449285	u7123	m477	UTAH	Sure.
L449284	u7122	m477	TYLER	Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
L449282	u7122	m477	TYLER	Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
L449281	u7123	m477	UTAH	I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
L449280	u7123	m477	UTAH	Wait, so I'm a big hero to my folks, right?  But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  And I hadn't been living my own life.  So I wanted something for myself.  Something that maybe didn't make any sense.  You know what I mean?
L449279	u7122	m477	TYLER	This gonna take long?
L449278	u7123	m477	UTAH	No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
L449277	u7122	m477	TYLER	What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
L449276	u7123	m477	UTAH	Well, I'm just gonna go back out there till I catch on to it or break my neck.
L449275	u7122	m477	TYLER	I can see that.  But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  Miniature golf.  Here, your number's 37.
L449274	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm serious.
L449273	u7122	m477	TYLER	Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
L449272	u7123	m477	UTAH	I need you to teach me.
L449271	u7122	m477	TYLER	I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
L449270	u7123	m477	UTAH	Shrimp and fries.
L449269	u7122	m477	TYLER	What do you want?
L449257	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
L449256	u7123	m477	UTAH	Bye.
L449255	u7123	m477	UTAH	I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
L449254	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Who cares!
L449253	u7123	m477	UTAH	My name's Johnny Utah!
L449252	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
L449251	u7123	m477	UTAH	Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
L449250	u7124	m477	WOMAN	Yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  Right?!  Well you figured wrong, dork!
L449249	u7123	m477	UTAH	Well, I saw you and--
L470649	u7283	m491	ROCKY	C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
L470648	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't say that.
L470647	u7283	m491	ROCKY	It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
L470646	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
L470645	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...I dunno.
L470644	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	What're we going to do?
L470643	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
L470642	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yeah, I can't beat him.
L470641	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Apollo?
L470640	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...I can't beat him.
L470639	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...What?
L470638	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...Can't do it.
L470635	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I gotta go out for a while.
L470634	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Is everything all right?
L470633	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
L470632	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	What did you say about a pet shop?
L470631	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...What?
L470630	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	What was that you said about a pet shop?
L470626	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yeah...
L470625	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
L470605	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Yes --
L470604	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Wanna hear a dirty joke?
L470572	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
L470571	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Are you going to say anything to him?
L470570	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
L470569	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
L470568	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
L470567	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...And he called the reporters --
L470548	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Ya right --  Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
L470547	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I thought it might be cute.
L470546	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
L470545	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	-- The legs.
L470544	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Can't fool around -- You look very great.
L470543	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't want weak legs.
L470542	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
L470541	u7283	m491	ROCKY	No... Sharp -- You look great.
L470540	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
L470539	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Sharp -- Real nice.
L470538	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Like?
L470537	u7283	m491	ROCKY	They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
L470536	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't you open them anymore?
L470390	u7283	m491	ROCKY	It did.
L470389	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Yes.
L470388	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
L470387	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I'll be waiting.
L470386	u7283	m491	ROCKY	'Bout seven.
L470385	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
L470384	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Ya puttin' me on, right?
L470383	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
L470382	u7283	m491	ROCKY	How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
L470299	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't tease me.
L470298	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I always knew you was pretty.
L470297	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Could ya take off that hat.
L470296	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...What?
L470295	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Do me another favor?
L470294	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...T-thank you.
L470293	u7283	m491	ROCKY	The glasses... Please.
L470292	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	What?
L470291	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Would ya take off your glasses?
L470290	u7283	m491	ROCKY	But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
L470289	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I should leave.
L470288	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
L470287	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
L470286	u7283	m491	ROCKY	They're all the same.
L470285	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
L470284	u7283	m491	ROCKY	It's all right -- You're my guest.
L470283	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	No, I don't belong here.
L470282	u7283	m491	ROCKY	It's okay.
L470281	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I don't think I belong here.
L470280	u7283	m491	ROCKY	What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
L470279	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	It's not that --
L470278	u7283	m491	ROCKY	It's only temporary.
L470277	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	It's fine.
L470276	u7283	m491	ROCKY	What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
L470274	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I'll call your brother.
L470273	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I think he might be worried.
L470272	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Why?
L470271	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Yes.
L470270	u7283	m491	ROCKY	You sure?
L470269	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Yes, I do.
L470268	u7283	m491	ROCKY	D'you really wanna call?
L470267	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I wanna let my brother know where I am.
L470266	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
L470265	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Do you have a phone?
L470264	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
L470263	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I sold them to you.
L470262	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
L470261	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...No thanks.
L470260	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Would ya like a glass of water?
L470259	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	'Cause you can't sing or dance?
L470258	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...Guess.
L470257	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
L470256	u7283	m491	ROCKY	After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
L470255	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Morning after?
L470254	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
L470253	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I don't think you're a bum.
L470252	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
L470251	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
L470250	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
L470249	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	It doesn't bother me either.
L470248	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
L470247	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...I suppose.
L470246	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I would say you're very shy by nature.
L470245	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...I suppose.
L470244	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Some people are very shy by nature.
L470237	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
L470236	u7283	m491	ROCKY	What's funny?
L470233	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	By accident?
L470232	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
L470224	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Ohh!
L470223	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I just dislocated my finger.
L470221	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Absolutely.
L470220	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
L470217	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	And you never got the chance?
L470216	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
L470215	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Aren't you skating?
L470201	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
L470200	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I think it's closed.
L470199	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Looks quiet, y'know.
L470198	u7283	m491	ROCKY	To you, to me it's Thursday.
L470197	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	It's Thanksgiving.
L469991	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Goodnight, Rocky.
L469990	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
L469906	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Shell-shocked!
L469905	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...I don't know.
L469904	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
L469901	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
L469900	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...I'm sorry.
L469899	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
L469898	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Fine.
L469897	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...How's the turtle food this week?
L470597	u7280	m491	PAULIE	You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
L470596	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	What?!
L470595	u7280	m491	PAULIE	You busted?!
L470594	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
L470593	u7280	m491	PAULIE	You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
L470592	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Owe you what?
L470591	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
L470590	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't do that again!
L470589	u7280	m491	PAULIE	I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
L470588	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
L470587	u7280	m491	PAULIE	You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
L470586	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Only a pig would say that!
L470585	u7280	m491	PAULIE	I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
L470584	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Paulie. Stop now!
L470579	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Get outta my life both of ya's.
L470578	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Don't talk like that to him!
L470577	u7280	m491	PAULIE	You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
L470576	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	It's not your house --
L470575	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
L470574	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Paulie!
L470573	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
L470380	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
L470379	u7280	m491	PAULIE	That so.
L470378	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
L470362	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	You didn't!
L470361	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Christ.
L470360	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Oh, Rocky!
L470349	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Paul.
L470348	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
L470185	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
L470184	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Why?
L470183	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	I can't go out.
L470182	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
L470181	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Like you?
L470180	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.

L470178	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
L470177	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	No... I can't!
L470176	u7280	m491	PAULIE	Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
L470175	u7264	m491	ADRIAN	...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
L470749	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...Thanks.
L470748	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
L470747	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...Stop jivin'!
L470746	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
L470745	u7265	m491	APOLLO	One more round.
L470744	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
L470736	u7265	m491	APOLLO	No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
L470735	u7284	m491	TRAINER	You're hurtin', man!
L470734	u7265	m491	APOLLO	No doctor!
L470733	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Get that doctor.
L470732	u7265	m491	APOLLO	My side.
L470720	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
L470719	u7265	m491	APOLLO	He got lucky.
L470718	u7284	m491	TRAINER	He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
L470717	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...That man's takin' his job too serious.
L470703	u7284	m491	TRAINER	People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
L470702	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
L470701	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
L470700	u7265	m491	APOLLO	I'll carry him 'till the third.
L470699	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
L470698	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...That boy damn near broke my arm.
L470156	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
L470155	u7284	m491	TRAINER	I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
L470154	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
L470153	u7284	m491	TRAINER	He won't last one round.
L470145	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...I don't feel heat from the name.
L470144	u7284	m491	TRAINER	Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
L470116	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Give my main man a raise!!
L470115	u7284	m491	TRAINER	You's the novelty, Champ!
L470114	u7265	m491	APOLLO	I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
L470152	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on.  Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
L470151	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
L470150	u7265	m491	APOLLO	'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
L470149	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...This man.
L470148	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
L470147	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...Still don't feel no heat.
L470146	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
L470143	u7265	m491	APOLLO	How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
L470142	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Fouls.
L470141	u7265	m491	APOLLO	How 'bout this Billy Snow?
L470119	u7265	m491	APOLLO	No, man, it's very smart.
L470118	u7275	m491	JERGENS	...It's very American.
L470117	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
L470111	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
L470110	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
L470105	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
L470104	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
L470103	u7275	m491	JERGENS	I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
L470102	u7265	m491	APOLLO	You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
L470095	u7275	m491	JERGENS	I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
L470094	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Damn.
L470031	u7265	m491	APOLLO	...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
L470030	u7269	m491	COMMENTATOR	Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
L470029	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
L470028	u7269	m491	COMMENTATOR	Where're you off to now?
L470027	u7265	m491	APOLLO	The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
L470026	u7269	m491	COMMENTATOR	Still to be held in Philadelphia?
L470025	u7265	m491	APOLLO	That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
L470024	u7269	m491	COMMENTATOR	You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
L470023	u7265	m491	APOLLO	He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
L470022	u7269	m491	COMMENTATOR	Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
L470021	u7265	m491	APOLLO	Very high an' very fast.
L470020	u7269	m491	COMMENTATOR	How was the flight, Champ?
L470136	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Move your shoulders down.
L470135	u7266	m491	BODYGUARD	Kiss my ass.
L470134	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Don't like yours neither.
L470133	u7266	m491	BODYGUARD	I don't like ya face.
L470130	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Does that bum have to say that?
L470129	u7266	m491	BODYGUARD	Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
L470128	u7283	m491	ROCKY	She ain't retarded, she's shy.
L470127	u7266	m491	BODYGUARD	Hear she's retarded.
L469922	u7266	m491	BODYGUARD	...Of the truck that run over your face.
L469921	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Of wa?
L469920	u7266	m491	BODYGUARD	Did ya get the license number?
L470066	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
L470065	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	We'll kill you, man -- We gotta gun.
L470052	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
L470051	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...That's an old one.
L470048	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Hey, give Rocky a dime.
L470047	u7283	m491	ROCKY	No dollar.
L470046	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
L470045	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Why?
L470044	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
L470043	u7283	m491	ROCKY	No wine.
L470042	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
L470041	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
L470040	u7267	m491	CHIPPED TOOTH	Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
L470242	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Charge it.
L470241	u7268	m491	CLEANER	...How 'bout for the Cokes?
L470240	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
L470239	u7268	m491	CLEANER	That's ten bucks.
L470235	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
L470234	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Here -- Three minutes.
L470230	u7283	m491	ROCKY	This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
L470229	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Cost ya a buck.
L470228	u7283	m491	ROCKY	How 'bout some Cokes?
L470227	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Six!
L470226	u7283	m491	ROCKY	It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight.  That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
L470225	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Seven minutes!
L470219	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
L470218	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Nine minutes!
L470214	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
L470213	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Ten minutes for ten dollars.
L470212	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...Ten minutes.
L470211	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Few minutes?
L470210	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
L470209	u7268	m491	CLEANER	This a con?
L470208	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
L470207	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
L470205	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
L470204	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
L470203	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
L470202	u7268	m491	CLEANER	Hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... Yo, we're closed!
L470731	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
L470730	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
L470713	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
L470712	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
L470711	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. Balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on Creed's temple -- not much movement from Balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- I mean explodes. The Champ backs off.
L470710	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
L470709	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
L470690	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Creed is down!!!
L470689	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
L470688	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
L470666	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	I agree.
L470665	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
L470664	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
L470663	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
L470662	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
L470661	u7271	m491	COMMENTATOR #2	Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
L470660	u7270	m491	COMMENTATOR #1	We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
L470529	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Not yellow, cautious.  See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
L470528	u7272	m491	DIPPER	Yo' yellow, old man.
L470524	u7272	m491	DIPPER	Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
L470523	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
L470522	u7272	m491	DIPPER	Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
L470521	u7277	m491	MICKEY	You can forget about sparring, kid.
L470518	u7272	m491	DIPPER	I'm happenin'! This pig is takin' my shot -- I iz a contender. He's nothin'.
L470517	u7277	m491	MICKEY	What's happenin' here?
L470516	u7272	m491	DIPPER	I say ya nothin'!
L469888	u7273	m491	FATS	Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
L469887	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Ya still light seventy.
L469886	u7273	m491	FATS	I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
L469885	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...The juice is climbin' every week.
L469884	u7273	m491	FATS	You have my food in ya hand.
L469883	u7283	m491	ROCKY	What about for food an' stuff?
L469882	u7273	m491	FATS	That's it.
L469881	u7283	m491	ROCKY	That's it? -- Completely?
L469880	u7273	m491	FATS	That's it, I'm broke.
L469879	u7283	m491	ROCKY	A hundred an' thirty.
L469878	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
L469877	u7273	m491	FATS	Bob.
L469876	u7283	m491	ROCKY	What's ya name again?
L469874	u7273	m491	FATS	Please, I need my hands to work -- Christ, don't bust my thumbs.
L469873	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
L469872	u7273	m491	FATS	Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
L469871	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
L469870	u7273	m491	FATS	Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
L470408	u7274	m491	GAZZO	Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
L470407	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
L470406	u7274	m491	GAZZO	Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
L470405	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Black market?

L470335	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
L470334	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
L470333	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Did you hear what I said?
L470332	u7283	m491	ROCKY	...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
L470331	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Rocky, would you be interested in fighting Apollo Creed for the Championship?
L470330	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
L470329	u7275	m491	JERGENS	What?

L470323	u7275	m491	JERGENS	Rocky, would you be interested in --
L470322	u7283	m491	ROCKY	No -- Just me.

L470083	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Listen, I hope ya don't --
L470081	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
L470080	u7276	m491	MARIE	What?
L470079	u7283	m491	ROCKY	That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
L470078	u7276	m491	MARIE	C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
L470077	u7283	m491	ROCKY	'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
L470076	u7276	m491	MARIE	Why?
L470075	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
L470074	u7276	m491	MARIE	Maybe I like garbage.
L470073	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Makes your breath like garbage.
L470072	u7276	m491	MARIE	I like yella teeth.

L470068	u7276	m491	MARIE	I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
L470067	u7283	m491	ROCKY	How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
L470061	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Don't you never say that --  -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
L470060	u7276	m491	MARIE	Stuff it, man!

L470054	u7276	m491	MARIE	...Screw you.

L470611	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Yo, Benny.
L470610	u7277	m491	MICKEY	What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
L470485	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I never had good footwork.
L470484	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
L470451	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
L470450	u7283	m491	ROCKY	I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
L470449	u7277	m491	MICKEY	If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
L470448	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.

L470427	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Fifty years, huh.
L470425	u7277	m491	MICKEY	I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
L470424	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Turtles -- domestic turtles.
L470423	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Whatta' those?
L470422	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Freak luck is a strange thing.
L470421	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
L470420	u7283	m491	ROCKY	Freak luck for sure.

L469977	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Ain't they?
L469976	u7283	m491	ROCKY	You think everybody I fight is a bum.
L469975	u7277	m491	MICKEY	Rice is a bum.
