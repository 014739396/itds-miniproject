L172451	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
L172450	u818	m52	CHICO	That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
L172449	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.

L172292	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's not bad for any day.
L172291	u818	m52	CHICO	He's going to make a good spy... that's not bad for the first day.
L172281	u818	m52	CHICO	We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
L172280	u820	m52	GROUCHO	"I'm glad I didn't ask you for ""Washington Crossing the Delaware""."
L172277	u818	m52	CHICO	Sure, we gotta have a spy.  If we no got a spy who's gonna tell the other side what we're doing?
L172276	u820	m52	GROUCHO	By the way, are you sure we need a spy?
L172275	u818	m52	CHICO	Send in the next girl. 
L172217	u818	m52	CHICO	I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
L172216	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
L172215	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
L172214	u818	m52	CHICO	You told it to me.
L172213	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
L172212	u820	m52	GROUCHO	What did you say to her?
L172211	u818	m52	CHICO	She did.
L172210	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Why didn't his niece slap your face?
L172209	u818	m52	CHICO	He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
L172208	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
L172207	u818	m52	CHICO	That's a-no good.  If I apologize we no got a war.  Look -- I send you a scrap of paper.  You send me a scrap of paper -- and we have a scrap.
L172206	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Then I demand an apology!

L172204	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Why wasn't I insulted?
L172203	u818	m52	CHICO	That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
L172202	u820	m52	GROUCHO	My card.
L172201	u818	m52	CHICO	Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
L172200	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
L172199	u818	m52	CHICO	I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
L172198	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You get half mine and I get half yours.
L172197	u818	m52	CHICO	What do I get?
L172196	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
L172195	u818	m52	CHICO	'At's-a fine.
L172194	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
L172193	u818	m52	CHICO	Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
L172192	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
L172191	u818	m52	CHICO	I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
L172190	u820	m52	GROUCHO	In that case you'll have to take a civil service examination --  if you pass I'll put you in the post-office -- stick out your tongue.
L172189	u818	m52	CHICO	I don't wanna work at all.
L172188	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Then you don't wanna work hard?
L172187	u818	m52	CHICO	That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
L172186	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Let's see -- What've I got in my cabinet besides mice --  I've got it -- how would you like to be Secretary of the Interior?
L172185	u818	m52	CHICO	What other job you got?
L172184	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I don't know what's keeping me.  I should've been here a long time ago. Now how about my proposition?
L172183	u818	m52	CHICO	Hello...  Yes...  No, not yet... All right...  Goodbye.  That was for you again.  He wants you to call him up as soon as you get back.
L172182	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
L172181	u818	m52	CHICO	Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
L172180	u820	m52	GROUCHO	If there was an open season for fellows like you, I'd get myself a hunting license.   Anyway, I'm going to make you a sporting proposition. You give up the peanut stand and I'll make you vice-president of the country.
L172179	u818	m52	CHICO	No, but I shot some ducks.
L172178	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Did you shoot the rapids?
L172177	u818	m52	CHICO	'At's-a no good.  I went to Niagara Falls once.
L172176	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
L172175	u818	m52	CHICO	Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
L172174	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You don't want to be a public nuisance, do you?
L172173	u818	m52	CHICO	Oh no, I can't do it.
L172172	u820	m52	GROUCHO	"I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling ""peanuts"" in front of the House of Representatives."
L172171	u818	m52	CHICO	That was for you.
L172166	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
L172165	u818	m52	CHICO	He only weighs ten ounces --
L172164	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
L172163	u818	m52	CHICO	I don't want him.
L172162	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I've got just the place for a man like you but I'm too busy right now to do any digging.  What do you call your dog when you want him?

L172157	u818	m52	CHICO	Yeh, he's only got one eye.
L172156	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Half watch dog?
L172155	u818	m52	CHICO	He's half poodle and half watch dog -
L172154	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well - what is he now?
L172153	u818	m52	CHICO	He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
L172152	u820	m52	GROUCHO	What kind of a dog is he?
L172151	u818	m52	CHICO	No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --

L172145	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
L172144	u818	m52	CHICO	How'm I doing, boss?
L172111	u820	m52	GROUCHO	The population must increase With great rapidity.  We give a couple seven years To raise a family. If, by that time, there is no branch Upon the family tree, we stand 'em up against the wall - and Pop goes the Weasel.

The last man nearly ruined this place He didn't know what to do with it.  If you think this country's bad off now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The treasury is low on dough; The last man went and flew with it.  If you think we're short of money now Just wait 'till I get through with it.  The country's taxes must be fixed - And I know what to do with it, If you think you're paying too much now, Just wait 'till I get through with it.

L172334	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Why - er - Mrs. Teasdale - this is an outrage!  This man is impossible... My course is clear...  this means war...  You RUNT!
L172333	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's it...
L172332	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Oh yes! -- UPSTART!
L172331	u820	m52	GROUCHO	No... it was a seven letter word.
L172330	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Was it -- swine?
L172329	u820	m52	GROUCHO	No, that wasn't it...
L172328	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Oh -- you mean... worm?
L172327	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I don't remember.
L172326	u822	m52	TRENTINO	What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
L172321	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Nothing doing!!  I've taken a lease on the battlefield.  I'd lose my deposit, besides, I've already ordered the ammunition...
L172320	u822	m52	TRENTINO	I am willing to apologize...  I'm willing to do anything to prevent this war.
L172319	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
L172318	u822	m52	TRENTINO	I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
L172259	u820	m52	GROUCHO	THEN IT'S WAR!
L172258	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Bah!! 
L172257	u820	m52	GROUCHO	How're ya fixed for ammunition?
L172256	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Yes.
L172255	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Then it's war?
L172245	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's it!  No man lives who can call a Firefly an upstart.
L172244	u822	m52	TRENTINO	You upstart!
L172243	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Once more! 
L172242	u822	m52	TRENTINO	You worm!
L172241	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Give me that again!
L172240	u822	m52	TRENTINO	You swine!
L172239	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's what you think.
L172236	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
L172235	u822	m52	TRENTINO	This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
L172230	u820	m52	GROUCHO	What can this mug offer you?  Wealth and family.  I can't give you wealth...  ...but we can have a little family of our own.
L172229	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Can't we go some place where we can be alone?
L172228	u820	m52	GROUCHO	When you get through with her feet, you can start on mine.  I haven't been to a chiropodist in two years...  If that's not an insult, I don't know what is.  Gloria, I love you.  I --
L172071	u820	m52	GROUCHO	And Vera niece, too.
L172070	u822	m52	TRENTINO	You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
L172069	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Go ahead.
L172068	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Excellency, may I present my niece.
L172067	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
L172066	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
L172065	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll give you Mrs. Teasdale as security.  or my jackknife.  If you want my advice, you'll take the jackknife... I've a better proposition...  Make it $25 and I'll give you a first mortgage on my son and I hope you foreclose.
L172064	u822	m52	TRENTINO	$50?
L172063	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
L172062	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
L172061	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
L172060	u822	m52	TRENTINO	I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
L172059	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's even a greater honor.
L172521	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	The king can do no wrong!
L172520	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You know I think they think I should be king.  Although it would please me to govern the throng, suppose I were king and then everything went wrong.
L172399	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
L172398	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	But -
L172397	u820	m52	GROUCHO	THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
L172396	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
L172395	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
L172394	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
L172393	u820	m52	GROUCHO	WHAT  ?
L172392	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
L172391	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's all right.  I'll fix you right up.
L172390	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
L172389	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Take a seat -- you're next. 
L172388	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	I hope I'm not interrupting.
L172347	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
L172346	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Why -- why -- of course.
L172345	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
L172343	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
L172342	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
L172341	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Now -- er --
L172340	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
L172325	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
L172324	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, won't you reconsider...
L172317	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Let him patch up his own breeches...
L172316	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
L172315	u820	m52	GROUCHO	So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
L172234	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
L172233	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
L172232	u820	m52	GROUCHO	All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
L172231	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, Rufus!
L172117	u820	m52	GROUCHO	He did?... I told my son not to leave it laying around... Where is son?
L172116	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Why, that's the speech that Lincoln made at Gettysburg...
L172115	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
L172114	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
L172113	u820	m52	GROUCHO	That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
L172112	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
L172099	u820	m52	GROUCHO	These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
L172098	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
L172097	u820	m52	GROUCHO	Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
L172096	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
L172056	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
L172055	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Your Excellency!
L172054	u820	m52	GROUCHO	No wonder he passed away.  I'd like to be with you to the very end. Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you -- I love you.
L172053	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Why - er -- my husband passed away...  I was with him to the very end.
L172052	u820	m52	GROUCHO	I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
L172051	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
L172050	u820	m52	GROUCHO	"Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- ""D"" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?"
L172049	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
L172046	u820	m52	GROUCHO	You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack...  Now what were you saying?
L172045	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	What'll I do with this card?
L172307	u822	m52	TRENTINO	For you, I would do anything... 
L172306	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Oh, would you...?
L172305	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Mrs. Teasdale, I'm willing to pocket my pride and do anything I can to make up with his Excellency.
L172248	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	This is terrible!
L172247	u822	m52	TRENTINO	I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
L172238	u822	m52	TRENTINO	I didn't come here to be insulted.
L172237	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
L172227	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
L172226	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Well no -- not exactly -- but --
L172225	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
L172224	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
L172223	u822	m52	TRENTINO	...but would further cement the relations of our countries.
L172022	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules Freedonia, to me you will always be the first lady of the land.
L172021	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Ambassador!  I am so anxious for you to meet our new dictator.
L172020	u822	m52	TRENTINO	What is money?  Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do anything.
L172019	u821	m52	MRS. TEASDALE	Your uncle has been such a friend to us in every crisis.  Without his country's financial aid --
L172309	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Perhaps he will listen to you...
L172308	u823	m52	VERA	If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
L172299	u823	m52	VERA	Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
L172298	u822	m52	TRENTINO	Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
L172297	u823	m52	VERA	I thought everything was working out fine.
L172296	u822	m52	TRENTINO	This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
L172251	u823	m52	VERA	It is every woman's problem.  Who supplies the sons? -- the brothers? -- the husbands?  Who...
L172250	u822	m52	TRENTINO	My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
L172249	u823	m52	VERA	Uncle, you can't do this!
L172029	u822	m52	TRENTINO	That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
L172028	u823	m52	VERA	Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
L172027	u822	m52	TRENTINO	With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
L172026	u823	m52	VERA	So that's the one you want to marry.

L503780	u2710	m177	BERT	Of course.

L503673	u2710	m177	BERT	After breakfast.  You're sounding tense, Janet.  Maybe I could give you a little massage?
L503672	u2716	m177	JANET	When do I get to see Brad?
L503643	u2710	m177	BERT	Home?
L503642	u2716	m177	JANET	Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
L503641	u2710	m177	BERT	Right!  An early start with Janet's debut on 'Good Morning Denton.' By the time we unveil Farley's 'Faith Factory' we will have earned our beauty sleep.
L503634	u2710	m177	BERT	On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
L503633	u2716	m177	JANET	Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
L503447	u2710	m177	BERT	It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
L503446	u2716	m177	JANET	I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
L503445	u2710	m177	BERT	Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular Hospital series featuring those perennial favorites, Cosmo and Nation McKinley. Neuro-specialists par excellence ...if you'll pardon my French. I recommend you send Brad to them for treatment!
L503444	u2716	m177	JANET	I've caught it once or twice.
L503443	u2710	m177	BERT	Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?

L503597	u2710	m177	BERT	Who trusts experts?
L503596	u2718	m177	MAC	We're the experts.
L503591	u2710	m177	BERT	Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
L503590	u2718	m177	MAC	With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
L503539	u2718	m177	MAC	SOLD??!!

L503536	u2710	m177	BERT	No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
L503535	u2718	m177	MAC	Of course, Mrs. Majors -- Janet -- But I'm puzzled.  If she was so keen on getting him in here, why wouldn't she sign the contract?

L503870	u2711	m177	BETTY	Really.  What'll I pin this on?
L503869	u2723	m177	OLIVER	President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
L503868	u2711	m177	BETTY	He was a President.
L503867	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Betty, it's imperative we get Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers and Brad out of that hell-hole before they both disappear forever. If only I could place that name -- McKinley?
L503820	u2723	m177	OLIVER	In a little masquerade?
L503819	u2711	m177	BETTY	Indulge?
L503818	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Care to indulge?
L503815	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Yes, Betty.  But the false promise of a new dawn is usually followed by a most bloody sunset.
L503814	u2711	m177	BETTY	Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.
L503771	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
L503770	u2711	m177	BETTY	Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
L503652	u2711	m177	BETTY	Oh I adore Coleridge Taylor.  As a matter of fact...
L503651	u2723	m177	OLIVER	A 'stately pleasure home' indeed.
L503650	u2711	m177	BETTY	It pays to know your way around, Oliver.
L503649	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Clever of you to find this spot, Betty.
L503640	u2711	m177	BETTY	Are you spoken for this evening?
L503639	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Yes, Betty.
L503638	u2711	m177	BETTY	Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
L503637	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Now Betty, don't overreact.
L503636	u2711	m177	BETTY	I bet that Macy Struthers had a hand in this.  We'll probably be replaced by an hour of fashion tips!
L503587	u2723	m177	OLIVER	...closed?
L503586	u2711	m177	BETTY	Conspiracy is right.  The Denton Dossier is...
L503575	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know, I find it...
L503574	u2711	m177	BETTY	Sounds like my husband.  He never came back either.  At least not after Flavors gave him a commercial break.
L503573	u2723	m177	OLIVER	It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
L503572	u2711	m177	BETTY	Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
L503449	u2711	m177	BETTY	Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
L503448	u2723	m177	OLIVER	McKinley?...McKinley?
L503427	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
L503426	u2711	m177	BETTY	Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
L503417	u2711	m177	BETTY	Everything's free there.
L503416	u2723	m177	OLIVER	A free thinker.
L503412	u2711	m177	BETTY	Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I separated maturity is something I look for in a man.
L503411	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
L503410	u2711	m177	BETTY	Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
L503409	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
L503408	u2711	m177	BETTY	Thank you so much, Judge Wright, for another wonderful interview.
L503388	u2723	m177	OLIVER	Well, Betty, there are many ways that the spider may catch the fly...
L503387	u2711	m177	BETTY	I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
L503386	u2723	m177	OLIVER	In a way...
L503817	u2727	m177	RALPH	No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
L503816	u2711	m177	BETTY	Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
L503584	u2727	m177	RALPH	You too, Betty!
L503583	u2711	m177	BETTY	Shove it, Ralph!
L503582	u2727	m177	RALPH	I'll leave you young things to it.
L503579	u2727	m177	RALPH	Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.  I just came to give you this.
L503578	u2711	m177	BETTY	Not at all.  You have your life.  And I have mine.
L503577	u2727	m177	RALPH	Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an inconvenient moment am I?

L503459	u2712	m177	BRAD	But I don't need treadment.
L503458	u2716	m177	JANET	What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
L503457	u2712	m177	BRAD	I'm not going, Janet.
L503433	u2716	m177	JANET	We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
L503432	u2712	m177	BRAD	I don't want to get up there.
L503431	u2716	m177	JANET	That's us.

L503876	u2720	m177	MOM	LIKE A VIRGIN WITH AN' URGIN' IN A SURGERY I'LL BE SWINGING -- I'LL BE BRINGING OUT THE NURSE IN ME
L503824	u2720	m177	MOM	Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
L503823	u2714	m177	DAD	Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
L503822	u2720	m177	MOM	Oh, Harry.  What are we going to do?
L503549	u2720	m177	MOM	He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
L503548	u2714	m177	DAD	What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
L503510	u2720	m177	MOM	Well I hadn't.  I was worried about inherited craziness when they married.  I said to Janet 'What do we know of his parents?'
L503509	u2714	m177	DAD	I'd forgotten.
L503508	u2720	m177	MOM	He was adopted you know.
L503507	u2714	m177	DAD	Mental instability?
L503371	u2720	m177	MOM	TENDERNESS AND INNOCENCE IN DENTON`
L503370	u2714	m177	DAD	YOU'LL FIND A RAMBLING ROSE AND A PICKET FENCE
L503933	u2722	m177	NEELY	And how does *'local girl'* Janet Majors fit into the scheme of things?
L503932	u2715	m177	FARLEY	Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
L503931	u2722	m177	NEELY	Could you tell us a little about it?
L503930	u2715	m177	FARLEY	Absolutely correct.
L503929	u2722	m177	NEELY	We've heard rumors that you're going to unveil more than just a new series tonight.  Is this true?
L503928	u2715	m177	FARLEY	Sure thing.
L503927	u2722	m177	NEELY	Mr.  Flavors -- may I have a moment of your time?
L503891	u2721	m177	NATION	He's a lame dog, remember?  But even he wouldn't want to see you like this.
L503890	u2716	m177	JANET	Brad!  Oh, Brad.
L503796	u2716	m177	JANET	Who?
L503795	u2721	m177	NATION	It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
L503627	u2716	m177	JANET	What do you mean?
L503626	u2721	m177	NATION	The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
L503625	u2716	m177	JANET	I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
L503612	u2716	m177	JANET	That doesn't make sense.
L503611	u2721	m177	NATION	But they only think they're happy.
L503498	u2721	m177	NATION	Of course.
L503497	u2716	m177	JANET	Could I do that later?
L503739	u2716	m177	JANET	I can't wear anything under it. That would spoil the line.
L503738	u2720	m177	MOM	You're practically naked!
L503737	u2716	m177	JANET	Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
L503736	u2720	m177	MOM	Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
L503735	u2716	m177	JANET	I've just come to tell you how fabulous I am.
L503554	u2720	m177	MOM	Your father doesn't like Mexicans.
L503553	u2716	m177	JANET	Why?
L503552	u2720	m177	MOM	You shouldn't have said that.
L503545	u2720	m177	MOM	Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
L503544	u2716	m177	JANET	Poor Brad.
L503527	u2716	m177	JANET	What show?
L503526	u2720	m177	MOM	Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
L503525	u2716	m177	JANET	It's...
L503524	u2720	m177	MOM	They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
L503522	u2720	m177	MOM	I know.
L503521	u2716	m177	JANET	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
L503520	u2720	m177	MOM	Oh my poor baby.
L503571	u2726	m177	PARKER	Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
L503570	u2716	m177	JANET	Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
L503569	u2726	m177	PARKER	Dentonvale...say, that's for...  I'm sorry to hear that, Janet.  Look I'm going to let you through, but keep it to yourself, otherwise...
L503568	u2716	m177	JANET	Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
L503567	u2726	m177	PARKER	Vance!  Vance Parker.
L503566	u2716	m177	JANET	I'm sorry, Officer.
L503565	u2726	m177	PARKER	Hey!  What are you trying to do?  Get yourself committed?
L503853	u2730	m177	TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD
L503852	u2716	m177	JANET	I NEED SOME
L503851	u2730	m177	TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD

L503849	u2730	m177	TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD
L503848	u2716	m177	JANET	I NEED SOME
L503847	u2730	m177	TRIO	YOUNG BLOOD
L503846	u2716	m177	JANET	I NEED SOME
L503841	u2730	m177	TRIO	OUR RAVING SAVIOUR THAT'S YOU!!
L503840	u2716	m177	JANET	BUT WITHOUT YOU AND ME, SIS  THE WORLD'D FALL TO PIECES  VENA CAVA WHO'S THE RAVER?
L503964	u2716	m177	JANET	I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
L503963	u2718	m177	MAC	Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
L503962	u2716	m177	JANET	BRAD!
L503798	u2716	m177	JANET	I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
L503797	u2718	m177	MAC	Brad!
L503748	u2718	m177	MAC	Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
L503747	u2716	m177	JANET	. . .For his own good.
L503689	u2718	m177	MAC	EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE BOY DRESSING UP HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY GREATEST JOY BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO BE DISCREET THERE'S ONE THING YOU JUST CAN'T BEAT THAT'S A STRAPLESS, BACKLESS CLASSICAL LITTLE BLACK
L503688	u2716	m177	JANET	But what'll I do?  What'll I say?  What'll I wear?
L503687	u2718	m177	MAC	You've got a really tight team around you.  And everybody needs you!
L503686	u2716	m177	JANET	Do you really think so?
L503685	u2718	m177	MAC	He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
L503684	u2716	m177	JANET	If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
L503683	u2718	m177	MAC	You are the most desirable creature that ever walked.
L503682	u2718	m177	MAC	Absolutely true.  Compared to all of them, you are perfection, flawless beauty.
L503681	u2716	m177	JANET	Is it true they're all midgets with big heads?
L503678	u2718	m177	MAC	I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
L503677	u2716	m177	JANET	I want to see Brad.
L503630	u2718	m177	MAC	It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
L503629	u2716	m177	JANET	Me?
L503628	u2718	m177	MAC	Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
L503610	u2718	m177	MAC	There are countless people in this world who believe they're happy.
L503609	u2716	m177	JANET	I'm...happy.
L503501	u2716	m177	JANET	No...couldn't I do this later?
L503500	u2718	m177	MAC	Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
L503490	u2718	m177	MAC	Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
L503489	u2716	m177	JANET	No!  He's never done that before.

L503645	u2718	m177	MAC	And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
L503644	u2721	m177	NATION	This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
L503632	u2721	m177	NATION	Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
L503631	u2718	m177	MAC	That's an extremely negative response.
L503608	u2721	m177	NATION	Yes how are you, Janet?  Are you happy?
L503607	u2718	m177	MAC	It's you we're concerned about, Janet.
L503593	u2718	m177	MAC	What does he know about it?
L503592	u2721	m177	NATION	Our field.
L503543	u2721	m177	NATION	I don't think he intends to go that far.
L503542	u2718	m177	MAC	HE!!??  How dare this person take advantage of my weakness.
L503533	u2718	m177	MAC	I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
L503532	u2721	m177	NATION	Our speciality.
L503485	u2721	m177	NATION	We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
L503484	u2718	m177	MAC	Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
L503883	u2727	m177	RALPH	THIS COULD TAKE US TO A TOWN THAT'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
L503882	u2719	m177	MACY	LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
L503881	u2727	m177	RALPH	THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
L503809	u2727	m177	RALPH	...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
L503808	u2719	m177	MACY	So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
L503777	u2719	m177	MACY	Surely.

L503938	u2721	m177	NATION	Isn't she lovely?
L503758	u2720	m177	MOM	We're not confused.
L503757	u2721	m177	NATION	And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
L503753	u2721	m177	NATION	No.
L503752	u2720	m177	MOM	And none of them worked?
L41091	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Get on! Anastasia, get on!
L41090	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Hurry, Grandmama!
L41067	u3674	m242	TATIANA	When you're older . . .
L41066	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	"Together in Paris! Oh, when can we be ""together in Paris?!"
L41065	u3674	m242	TATIANA	It's where I've made my home but I do have something for you . . .
L41064	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	Oh, Grandmama, why do you have to go back to Paris?
L41063	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I know, but I had to because . . .
L41062	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
L41061	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	How to read.
L41060	u3674	m242	TATIANA	What were you showing her?
L41059	u3666	m242	ANASTASIA	I was showing Sonya something . . .
L41058	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Why were you so late tonight
L41132	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then come find me.
L41131	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
L41130	u3667	m242	ANYA	Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
L41129	u3670	m242	GREGOR	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
L41128	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have to go now, before it gets light.
L41123	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm not sure but look. . .
L41122	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Where is your home, Anya?
L41117	u3667	m242	ANYA	No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
L41116	u3670	m242	GREGOR	Are you running away?
L41592	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	No. From now on I am your loyal subject ... your highness. By your leave?
L41591	u3667	m242	ANYA	Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
L41590	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
L41586	u3667	m242	ANYA	Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
L41585	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41584	u3667	m242	ANYA	Poor Meetoo!
L41583	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Yes, your highness.
L41582	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
L41397	u3667	m242	ANYA	Not you. Him.
L41396	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I shant!
L41395	u3667	m242	ANYA	You'll laugh.
L41394	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Come out! I can do alterations.
L41393	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I look ridiculous!
L41383	u3667	m242	ANYA	You must have.
L41382	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Did I tell you that?
L41373	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
L41372	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We're just going to refresh your memory...
L41368	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah ... the Lady Sophie... The ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the Empress. We must convince Sophie that you are the Princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the Empress ... your grandmother, I mean.
L41367	u3667	m242	ANYA	Who's Sophie?
L41366	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
L41356	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm fine.
L41355	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Is everyone all right?
L41348	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	She's quite right, Dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
L41347	u3667	m242	ANYA	Noooo....
L41242	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
L41241	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
L41201	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Good day!
L41200	u3667	m242	ANYA	Well, I don't have any money . . .
L41199	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
L41198	u3667	m242	ANYA	I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them!   Do you know Dmitri?
L41197	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Who did you hear it from?
L41633	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'll never let go!
L41632	u3667	m242	ANYA	Don't let me go!
L41621	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya... where are we?
L41620	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri?
L41559	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
L41497	u3667	m242	ANYA	No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
L41496	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No! Well, yes, but
L41495	u3667	m242	ANYA	Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
L41494	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anya, wait!
L41486	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Don't be
L41485	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm so scared...
L41447	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You'll convince her. You have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
L41446	u3667	m242	ANYA	Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
L41445	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Nervous?
L41434	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's okay. Didn't hurt..
L41433	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh! I'm sorry...
L41412	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hey! It doesn't matter! You gotta make your own way in the world! Don't be sorry for me! I'm going to get what I want don't you worry!
L41411	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry.
L41410	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
L41409	u3667	m242	ANYA	I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
L41408	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
L41407	u3667	m242	ANYA	Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
L41406	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Sad?
L41405	u3667	m242	ANYA	It's so beautiful ... and sad.
L41400	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's not you - it's the dress!
L41399	u3667	m242	ANYA	You said you wouldn't laugh!
L41389	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
L41388	u3667	m242	ANYA	What a beautiful ship!
L41386	u3667	m242	ANYA	The dessert fork!
L41385	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's the best fork of all
L41384	u3667	m242	ANYA	...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
L41381	u3667	m242	ANYA	Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
L41380	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Every Russian family has one..
L41371	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You are the Princess.
L41370	u3667	m242	ANYA	You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
L41354	u3667	m242	ANYA	You shouldn't have pushed us!
L41353	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You must enjoy causing me pain!
L41351	u3667	m242	ANYA	No!
L41350	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on!
L41346	u3667	m242	ANYA	HUH?!
L41345	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Now just get off the train.
L41344	u3667	m242	ANYA	Forged papers! Now, what?!
L41342	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Trying... to... breathe...
L41341	u3667	m242	ANYA	Just what do you think you're doing?!
L41340	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why?
L41339	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Come on up!
L41334	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
L41333	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm going to stretch my legs
L41318	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I was all out of dynamite!
L41317	u3667	m242	ANYA	By pulling my hair?!
L41316	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I wasn't bothering you. I was trying to wake you up!
L41315	u3667	m242	ANYA	Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
L41314	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
L41248	u3667	m242	ANYA	Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  Look at me!
L41247	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You never thought of the possibility?
L41245	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
L41244	u3667	m242	ANYA	I have my reasons.
L41243	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Why do you want to go to Paris?
L41239	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
L41238	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
L41237	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
L41236	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
L41235	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What happened to your parents?
L41234	u3669	m242	DMITRI	People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
L41222	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Who are you?!
L41221	u3667	m242	ANYA	AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
L41195	u3669	m242	DMITRI	That's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
L41194	u3667	m242	ANYA	I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
L41193	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Ouch!  That really hurt!
L41605	u3674	m242	TATIANA	And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
L41604	u3667	m242	ANYA	I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
L41602	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Yes, you do. You do.
L41601	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
L41600	u3674	m242	TATIANA	This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
L41599	u3667	m242	ANYA	And this is my future. This is who I am!
L41598	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
L41597	u3667	m242	ANYA	I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
L41596	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Is it? Is this what you want?
L41595	u3667	m242	ANYA	If I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
L41594	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
L41593	u3667	m242	ANYA	Why does everyone have to act that way?
L41589	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
L41588	u3667	m242	ANYA	Dmitri didn't want the money?
L41579	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
L41578	u3667	m242	ANYA	Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
L41577	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't you, child?
L41533	u3674	m242	TATIANA	No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
L41532	u3667	m242	ANYA	No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
L41531	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia! It was just a bat! It's gone, dear...
L41525	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
L41524	u3667	m242	ANYA	... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
L41519	u3667	m242	ANYA	THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
L41518	u3674	m242	TATIANA	PAR AWAY, LONG AGO GLOWING DEEP AS AN EMBER
L41514	u3667	m242	ANYA	I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
L41513	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Do you remember this?
L41512	u3667	m242	ANYA	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
L41511	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Who are you, child?
L41474	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Shut up!
L41473	u3668	m242	BARTOK	PARSE HOLDS THE KEY TO MY HEART FRENCH- BAT- CHICKS HANG OUT AT MONTMARTRE WE'LL EAT SOME IN-SECTS THEN GO BACK AND HAVE --
L41431	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Me? No. Rich food - it kills me. Ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
L41430	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok ... have you ever been to Paris?
L41427	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	She leads a charmed life, that little one ... Someone is always there to save her. In the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
L41426	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
L41417	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
L41416	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting pneumonia. I have a fever. Feel my forehead...
L41415	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Bartok... a question.
L41414	u3668	m242	BARTOK	I'm getting a chest cold..
L41361	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oy... not a road trip. I get wagon sick, you know that.
L41360	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. We must get close to her.
L41288	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
L41287	u3668	m242	BARTOK	You'd lose your security deposit?
L41286	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
L41281	u3668	m242	BARTOK	"My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said ""Curses were made to be broken"". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound..."
L41280	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I cursed then all!
L41279	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
L41275	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	How do you know?
L41274	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Trust me, it's her!
L41272	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
L41271	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
L41270	u3668	m242	BARTOK	So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
L41268	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Why would I ever be angry with you, little friend?
L41267	u3668	m242	BARTOK	No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
L41266	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
L41264	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	And what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
L41263	u3668	m242	BARTOK	Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
L41262	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	What?
L41565	u3669	m242	DMITRI	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
L41564	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	So where will you go?
L41563	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Watch me.
L41562	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	But this invitation came from the Empress herself! It's the social event of the decade! You can't turn it down!
L41470	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
L41469	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you mean?
L41468	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
L41466	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you feeling all right?
L41464	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	We did it! We did it, my boy! We're going to see Tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! Rich!
L41439	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It worked in Odessa...
L41438	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"The ""Odessa Dunk""?"
L41437	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"If I used the word ""bleak"" I would be optimistic."
L41436	u3669	m242	DMITRI	How is our current financial status?
L41377	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ah! Let us begin!
L41376	u3669	m242	DMITRI	See? The Princess is under there ...
L41331	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Pray he's color-blind...
L41330	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	What do we do now?
L41325	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
L41324	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
L41323	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
L41322	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're a princess...
L41309	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	"What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness""."
L41308	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Wake up, your highness - we should start getting used to saying it.
L41307	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
L41305	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
L41304	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Hurry up with those papers.
L41231	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Ew. . .  the honest type.
L41230	u3669	m242	DMITRI	"She doesn't want to do anything ""dishonest"". . ."
L41227	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Look!
L41226	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	He's her?
L41225	u3669	m242	DMITRI	It's her.
L41213	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
L41212	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What was that?
L41191	u3669	m242	DMITRI	We will.  We <u>have</u> to.  Come on, Vlad - she's out there.
L41190	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	It's no use, Dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
L41624	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Run, Anya -  go...
L41623	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I'll show you!
L41572	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
L41571	u3669	m242	DMITRI	You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
L41570	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	The same thing I wanted ten years ago - all the Romonovs dead I got the others, now I have to finish up with that nuisance, Anastasia...
L41569	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What do you want?!
L41568	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	I know, I know ... you thought I was dead. That's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of Russia, which I SHOULD HAVE BEEN - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
L41567	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Rasputin!
L41566	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	So. You don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
L41558	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
L41557	u3669	m242	DMITRI	And tell me that she's happy.
L41556	u3674	m242	TATIANA	She does.
L41555	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Promise me she'll have her home.
L41554	u3674	m242	TATIANA	That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
L41553	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I should go
L41552	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You are the boy ...
L41549	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Empress, no! I will not take the money! I just came to tell you I was sorry...
L41548	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
L41547	u3669	m242	DMITRI	No. Empress, you --
L41546	u3674	m242	TATIANA	I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
L41507	u3669	m242	DMITRI	What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
L41506	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
L41502	u3674	m242	TATIANA	You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately!
L41501	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I'm not Ulo and I won't slow down. But you will listen to me!
L41491	u3674	m242	TATIANA	Remove him at once.
L41490	u3669	m242	DMITRI	Please, if you'd just listen...
L41489	u3674	m242	TATIANA	How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
L41488	u3669	m242	DMITRI	I need to speak with the Dowager Empress ...
L41074	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	After all I've done for your family - YOU TRIED TO KILL MEEEEEE ! ! !
L41073	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I did no such thing!
L41072	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	You gave the orders!
L41071	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	I had nothing to do with it!
L41070	u3672	m242	RASPUTIN	Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
L41069	u3671	m242	NICHOLAS	Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
L41462	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens, no... but ...  She is going to be at the Ballet Russe tonight! That's the Russian Ballet - Russe for Russian, oh those crazy French... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
L41461	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Perhaps you could convince her?
L41460	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
L41459	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
L41458	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
L41457	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
L41449	u3673	m242	SOPHIE	Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
L41448	u3675	m242	VLADIMIR	May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!

L415045	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	He's conducting experiments of his own.
L415044	u6872	m459	SALLY	When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
L415043	u6872	m459	SALLY	He stayed a long time.
L415042	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Uh-huh.
L414994	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	I could.  Of course I could. But no one would be like you...  I'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
L414993	u6872	m459	SALLY	Can't you make other creations?
L414992	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Then we'll both starve...  An old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
L414990	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
L414989	u6872	m459	SALLY	But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.
L414987	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
L414986	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
L414985	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Why not?
L414984	u6872	m459	SALLY	No.

L414974	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Good.  I'm hungry.
L414973	u6872	m459	SALLY	Coming...
L414933	u6872	m459	SALLY	Just me, I suppose...  I'm restless.  I can't help it.
L414932	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Just what?
L414931	u6872	m459	SALLY	That's not true.  It's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I'm indebted to you for everything... It's just...
L414930	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
L414929	u6872	m459	SALLY	I know.
L414928	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
L414927	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	That's twice this month you've slipped Deadly Night Shade into my tea and run off.  People might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
L414926	u6872	m459	SALLY	I can't help it.
L414925	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
L414924	u6872	m459	SALLY	I'm grown up now.  I have to leave some time.
L414923	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	If you went away, what would become of me?
L414922	u6872	m459	SALLY	I know.

L414919	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414918	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
L414917	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414916	u6869	m459	EVIL SCIENTIST	For this.
L414915	u6872	m459	SALLY	Yes.
L414890	u6872	m459	SALLY	No!

L468107	u7258	m490	FRANK	Rocky!
L468106	u7255	m490	BRAD	Janet!
L468094	u7258	m490	FRANK	Hmmmm.  He'll be in the Zen Room.
L468093	u7255	m490	BRAD	He might be.  I don't know.
L468092	u7258	m490	FRANK	And now he works for your Government, doesn't he, Brad?  He's attached to the Bureau of Investigation of that which you call U.F.O's.  Isn't he, Brad?
L468091	u7255	m490	BRAD	He was a Science Teacher at Denton High.
L468090	u7258	m490	FRANK	I know what you told me, Brad. But this Dr Everett Scott.  His name is not unknown to me.
L468089	u7255	m490	BRAD	I was telling the truth.
L468088	u7255	m490	BRAD	I told you, my car broke down.
L468087	u7258	m490	FRANK	I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
L468040	u7258	m490	FRANK	On my mother's grave.
L468039	u7255	m490	BRAD	You promise you won't tell?
L468038	u7258	m490	FRANK	Oh come on, Brad, admit it.  It was enjoyable, wasn't it?  There's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure.
L468037	u7255	m490	BRAD	Like this.  Like how?  It's your fault - you're to blame.  I thought it was the real thing.
L468036	u7258	m490	FRANK	Shush.  Janet's probably asleep by now. Do you want her to see you like this?
L468035	u7255	m490	BRAD	Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
L468034	u7258	m490	FRANK	I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
L468033	u7255	m490	BRAD	You tricked me.  I wouldn't have - I've never - never.
L468032	u7258	m490	FRANK	Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
L468031	u7255	m490	BRAD	Why you - what have you done with Janet?
L468030	u7258	m490	FRANK	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
L468029	u7255	m490	BRAD	You!

L467807	u7257	m490	FAMILY	Janet
L467806	u7255	m490	BRAD	Made me give you the eye And then panic,
L467805	u7257	m490	FAMILY	Janet.
L467788	u7255	m490	BRAD	I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
L467787	u7257	m490	FAMILY	Janet.
L467786	u7255	m490	BRAD	So please don't tell me to can it.
L467785	u7257	m490	FAMILY	Janet.
L467784	u7255	m490	BRAD	The future is ours so let's plan it.
L468051	u7260	m490	JANET	If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
L468050	u7255	m490	BRAD	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
L468049	u7260	m490	JANET	I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
L468048	u7255	m490	BRAD	So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
L468047	u7260	m490	JANET	I could see Brad's face before me and my mind screamed No!  But my lips were hungry - too hungry.
L468046	u7255	m490	BRAD	And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to turn to stone The sweeter the wine The harder to make the break You hear something about someone You'd thought you'd known.
L468045	u7260	m490	JANET	I'm engaged to Brad just the same as Betty Monroe was to Ralph Hapschatt. But Frank's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy I've never dreamt of before. Hot, burning kisses.
L468028	u7260	m490	JANET	I hope so my darling.
L468027	u7255	m490	BRAD	Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
L468026	u7260	m490	JANET	Maybe we could try it this way.
L468009	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh don't be so shy.
L468008	u7255	m490	BRAD	No, don't do that.
L468007	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh, I hope so my darling.  But let me switch on the light.
L468006	u7255	m490	BRAD	It's alright Janet.  Everything's going to be alright.

L467936	u7255	m490	BRAD	Weiss.
L467935	u7260	m490	JANET	Weiss.
L467934	u7255	m490	BRAD	I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
L467924	u7255	m490	BRAD	It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
L467923	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh Brad.
L467911	u7255	m490	BRAD	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
L467910	u7260	m490	JANET	Right!
L467903	u7255	m490	BRAD	I'm here, there's nothing to worry about.
L467902	u7260	m490	JANET	Brad - I'm cold, I'm wet, and plain scared.
L467901	u7255	m490	BRAD	They're probably foreigners with ways different from our own.  -  They may do some more folk dancing.
L467900	u7260	m490	JANET	This isn't the Junior Chamber of Commerce Brad.
L467899	u7255	m490	BRAD	Let's wait awhile Janet.  We don't want to interfere with their celebrations.
L467898	u7260	m490	JANET	Then ask the butler - or someone.
L467897	u7255	m490	BRAD	We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
L467896	u7260	m490	JANET	Well I want to leave.
L467895	u7255	m490	BRAD	It's just a..a party Janet.
L467894	u7260	m490	JANET	But it seems so unhealthy here.
L467893	u7255	m490	BRAD	For God's sake keep a grip on yourself Janet.
L467892	u7260	m490	JANET	Brad, please lets get out of here.
L467891	u7255	m490	BRAD	Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
L467890	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh....Say something.
L467862	u7255	m490	BRAD	Oh, it's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
L467861	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh Brad, I'm frightened.  What kind of place is this?
L467857	u7255	m490	BRAD	Yes.
L467856	u7260	m490	JANET	Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
L467852	u7255	m490	BRAD	Just a moment, Janet.  They may have a telephone.
L467851	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh, Brad.  Let's go back.  I'm cold and I'm frightened.
L467829	u7260	m490	JANET	I'm coming with you.  Besides, darling, the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back.
L467828	u7255	m490	BRAD	There's no point both of us getting wet.
L467827	u7260	m490	JANET	I'm coming with you.
L467826	u7255	m490	BRAD	Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
L467825	u7260	m490	JANET	But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
L467824	u7255	m490	BRAD	You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
L467823	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh...
L467822	u7255	m490	BRAD	We must have a blow-out.
L467821	u7260	m490	JANET	What was that bang?
L467820	u7255	m490	BRAD	Hmmm ... Well, I guess we will have to turn back.
L467819	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh dear!  But then where did the motorcyclists come from?
L467818	u7255	m490	BRAD	I think we took the wrong fork a few miles back.
L467816	u7255	m490	BRAD	Yes, Janet.  Life's pretty cheap to that type.
L467815	u7260	m490	JANET	Gosh.  That's the third motorcyclist that's passed us.  They certainly take their lives in their hands.  What with the weather and all.
L467810	u7255	m490	BRAD	Dammit, Janet.
L467809	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh Brad, I'm mad.
L467801	u7260	m490	JANET	For you.
L467800	u7255	m490	BRAD	Oh Janet
L467782	u7260	m490	JANET	Oh Brad.
L467781	u7255	m490	BRAD	I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
L467780	u7260	m490	JANET	Uh huh.
L467779	u7255	m490	BRAD	I've got something to say.
L467778	u7260	m490	JANET	Yes Brad.
L467777	u7260	m490	JANET	Yes.
L467776	u7255	m490	BRAD	And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
L467775	u7260	m490	JANET	Yes.
L467774	u7255	m490	BRAD	Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
L467773	u7260	m490	JANET	Yes.
L468220	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	Yes.
L468219	u7255	m490	BRAD	Good God.
L468086	u7255	m490	BRAD	I most certainly do.  He happens to be an old friend of mine.
L468085	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	You know this earth - this person.
L468084	u7255	m490	BRAD	Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.

L467854	u7255	m490	BRAD	Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
L467853	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	Hello.
L468229	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
L468228	u7256	m490	DR SCOTT	Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
L468227	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	Dr Scott I'm sorry about your nephew.
L468226	u7256	m490	DR SCOTT	You're OK by me.
L468225	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	A decision had to be made.
L468224	u7256	m490	DR SCOTT	You did right.
L468214	u7262	m490	RIFF RAFF	Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
L468213	u7256	m490	DR SCOTT	Great Heavens, that's a laser.
L468141	u7260	m490	JANET	Makes you cry
L468140	u7258	m490	FRANK	What guy

L468019	u7258	m490	FRANK	Well, I'm sure you're not spent yet.
L468018	u7260	m490	JANET	Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
L468017	u7258	m490	FRANK	Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
L468015	u7258	m490	FRANK	I know.  But it wasn't all bad was it? In fact, I think you found it quite pleasurable. Mmmmm so soft, so sensual.
L468014	u7260	m490	JANET	You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
L468013	u7258	m490	FRANK	Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
L468012	u7260	m490	JANET	You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
L467980	u7258	m490	FRANK	I didn't make him for you
L467979	u7260	m490	JANET	Well.    I don't like men with...er, with too many, muscles.

L524725	u7761	m525	KYLE	I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it!  <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
L524722	u7770	m525	STAN	What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
L524721	u7761	m525	KYLE	It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
L524701	u7761	m525	KYLE	Isn't that in Arizona or something?
L524700	u7770	m525	STAN	All it says is that it's above the vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?
L524699	u7761	m525	KYLE	Does it say what the clitoris is?
L524623	u7761	m525	KYLE	Yeah, they suck.
L524622	u7770	m525	STAN	I'm so sick of these soldiers.

L524599	u7761	m525	KYLE	Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
L524595	u7770	m525	STAN	What's the difference?
L524594	u7761	m525	KYLE	Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in your head or your ass?
L524593	u7761	m525	KYLE	Good thing she was never your girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.
L524592	u7770	m525	STAN	I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!
L524591	u7761	m525	KYLE	Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
L524523	u7770	m525	STAN	She's Not! But if she WAS it would be THAT little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
L524522	u7761	m525	KYLE	I thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
L524521	u7770	m525	STAN	That British dickhole is what's taking Wendy away from me!
L524520	u7761	m525	KYLE	I don't know, dude.
L524519	u7770	m525	STAN	What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?
L524509	u7770	m525	STAN	How do we do that?
L524508	u7761	m525	KYLE	Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
L524355	u7761	m525	KYLE	Our moms suck!
L524354	u7770	m525	STAN	Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
L524316	u7761	m525	KYLE	It isn't fair!
L524315	u7770	m525	STAN	How can they do this?
L524288	u7761	m525	KYLE	You bastards!!

L524263	u7770	m525	STAN	OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!
L524256	u7770	m525	STAN	Yeah...
L524255	u7761	m525	KYLE	Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
L524170	u7770	m525	STAN	Yeah!
L524169	u7761	m525	KYLE	I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
L524168	u7770	m525	STAN	Nowhere.
L524161	u7761	m525	KYLE	Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
L524160	u7770	m525	STAN	Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
L524126	u7770	m525	STAN	She's not my girlfriend, dude!
L524125	u7761	m525	KYLE	Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
L524114	u7761	m525	KYLE	Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
L524113	u7770	m525	STAN	<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
L524065	u7770	m525	STAN	Where do they come up with this stuff?!
L524064	u7761	m525	KYLE	That was sweet!
L524048	u7761	m525	KYLE	We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
L524047	u7770	m525	STAN	This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
L524013	u7770	m525	STAN	Kyle, check it out.
L524012	u7761	m525	KYLE	Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
L525279	u7771	m525	STAN'S MOTHER	-Or monkey fucker-
L525278	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Shiteater-
L525155	u7771	m525	STAN'S MOTHER	We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
L525154	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
L525152	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
L525151	u7771	m525	STAN'S MOTHER	Oh Lord, what have we done...?
L525093	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
L525092	u7771	m525	STAN'S MOTHER	Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
L524294	u7771	m525	STAN'S MOTHER	He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
L524293	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
L524180	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What is 'fisting'?
L524179	u7771	m525	STAN'S MOTHER	Oh dear God...
L524771	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Right away, ma'am!
L524770	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	I'm needing lunch.
L524769	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Yes?
L524768	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	And Bill?
L524767	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Yes ma'am!
L524766	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
L524765	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
L524671	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
L524670	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
L524669	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
L524668	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	Huh?
L524667	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What about air strikes?
L524666	u7766	m525	PRESIDENT	As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
L524665	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
L525197	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh God... What have I done...
L525196	u7769	m525	SATAN	SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
L525195	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
L525194	u7769	m525	SATAN	Yes... And in doing so, you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming.
L525191	u7769	m525	SATAN	YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME... NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!
L525190	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh.
L525189	u7769	m525	SATAN	SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
L525188	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
L525187	u7769	m525	SATAN	I am the dark master!
L525186	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What the hell is going on?!
L525185	u7769	m525	SATAN	You're all part of Satan's army now!
L524202	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	You are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
L524201	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	But I-
L524200	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is impeaching you.
L524199	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Article 42!  You don't mean-?!
L524198	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
L524197	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
L524196	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	We must take action on this immediately.
L524191	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
L524190	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
L524189	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	What is Terrance and Phillip?
L524188	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
L524178	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	No, worse. Here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
L524177	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	The F word?!
L524176	u7767	m525	PRINCIPAL VICTORIA	No, it was worse than that...
L524175	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
L524497	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Alright, I'll make the call...
L524496	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
L524495	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
L524494	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	Then we'll have to resort to plan B and call the v-chip organization.
L524493	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
L524492	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
L524491	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Very encouraging. Most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
L524490	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	How is the children's progress?
L524431	u7762	m525	KYLE'S MOTHER	This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
L524430	u7764	m525	MR. MACKEY	Uh, we're just, starting our program...
L525246	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of words!
L525245	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	You're quite a purveyor of filth, little boy!
L525162	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Terrance! NO!
L525161	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	AGH!
L525158	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	You did? Just now?
L525157	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!
L525121	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Canada is saving us!!
L525120	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	What's going on Terrance?
L525063	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	I know, Terrance. I know.
L525062	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
L525058	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
L525057	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
L524478	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	You would know, dummy.
L524477	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Oh, you are such a maroon!
L524452	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
L524451	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
L524446	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Don't believe the hype!!
L524445	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
L524444	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Fight the power!
L524347	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
L524346	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
L524345	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
L524333	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Cheers, Terrance!
L524332	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.
L524325	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Hello, Brooke Shields!
L524324	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Hello, Conan!
L524241	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	I sure did, Phillip!!
L524240	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
L524239	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	You bet, Terrance!
L524238	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Say Phillip, want to see the Northern Lights?
L524237	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
L524236	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
L524088	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
L524087	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
L524086	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	YOU'D fuck your uncle!
L524085	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	You'd fuck your uncle!
L524079	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever tell my son that I licked your hairy balls.'
L524078	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
L524077	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	It's from your mother.
L524076	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	A letter from who, you shit sucking cock master?
L524075	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I just got a letter!
L524073	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	Oh yeah!
L524072	u7772	m525	TERRANCE	Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
L524071	u7765	m525	PHILLIP	What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
L525241	u7769	m525	SATAN	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
L525240	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!
L525238	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
L525237	u7769	m525	SATAN	Ow, you're hurting me!
L525236	u7769	m525	SATAN	I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
L525235	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
L525234	u7769	m525	SATAN	If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
L525233	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
L525232	u7769	m525	SATAN	Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
L525210	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not hear okay?
L525209	u7769	m525	SATAN	No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't just renege on a deal. That's lying.
L525206	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking with him!
L525205	u7769	m525	SATAN	I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!
L525199	u7769	m525	SATAN	No! It can't be!
L525198	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, I'm missing the party!
L524922	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
L524921	u7769	m525	SATAN	What if I just left?
L524919	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	<b>Hey, guy, relax, put out! You gotta relax, shut your mouth- Baby I'd do anything for ya! Now don't make me smack you in the eye like last time-</b>
L524918	u7769	m525	SATAN	<b>What if I, don't wanna put out? That's all you ever say Relax put out I'm a living creature, I have feelings too, I don't need this abuse from you-</b>
L524916	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
L524915	u7769	m525	SATAN	Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.

L524797	u7769	m525	SATAN	Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
L524796	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon thing has got you all stressed out. Let's make love.
L524795	u7769	m525	SATAN	You don't care.

L524693	u7769	m525	SATAN	Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
L524692	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.

L524684	u7769	m525	SATAN	No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
L524683	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
L524682	u7769	m525	SATAN	It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen are drawing nigh!  The time of the prophecy is upon us!
L524677	u7769	m525	SATAN	I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
L524676	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.

L524563	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Who's my cream puff?
L524562	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, come here, guy.
L524561	u7769	m525	SATAN	Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
L524560	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
L524559	u7769	m525	SATAN	I don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
L524554	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
L524553	u7769	m525	SATAN	Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
L524550	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
L524549	u7769	m525	SATAN	Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
L524407	u7769	m525	SATAN	You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't you?!
L524406	u7768	m525	SADDAM HUSSEIN	Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell, kid! Relax! Take a load off!!

L616033	u8465	m575	ANYA	No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
L616032	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Baloney!
L616031	u8465	m575	ANYA	I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
L616030	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Will you leave me alone?
L616029	u8465	m575	ANYA	And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
L616028	u8470	m575	LOTHER	--and I can tell you where to get off.
L616027	u8465	m575	ANYA	Oh--a hundred times--
L616026	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I didn't ask you to come away with me--
L616025	u8465	m575	ANYA	Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
L616024	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
L616023	u8465	m575	ANYA	Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
L616022	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
L616021	u8465	m575	ANYA	Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
L616017	u8465	m575	ANYA	Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
L616016	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I can explain--
L616015	u8465	m575	ANYA	So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
L616008	u8465	m575	ANYA	And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
L616007	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I'll join you later.
L616006	u8465	m575	ANYA	Well--shall we go into dinner?
L616005	u8465	m575	ANYA	Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
L616004	u8470	m575	LOTHER	This is Miss Marsh.
L616003	u8465	m575	ANYA	Hope we're not intruding.
L615889	u8465	m575	ANYA	I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
L615888	u8470	m575	LOTHER	But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
L615661	u8465	m575	ANYA	That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
L615660	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
L615659	u8465	m575	ANYA	Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
L615658	u8465	m575	ANYA	I never want to go back....
L615657	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Sure!
L615656	u8465	m575	ANYA	When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
L615655	u8470	m575	LOTHER	How'd you ever get away with it?
L615654	u8465	m575	ANYA	You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
L615653	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
L615652	u8465	m575	ANYA	It would be a nice change from you.
L615651	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Do you want the truth, Anya?
L615650	u8465	m575	ANYA	Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
L615649	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
L615648	u8465	m575	ANYA	Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
L615647	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Anya, I think you're crazy.
L615640	u8465	m575	ANYA	Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
L615639	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Anya!
L616287	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
L616286	u8465	m575	ANYA	No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
L616132	u8465	m575	ANYA	Yes--and <U>very</U> popular-- 
L616131	u8467	m575	BRETT	Isn't she lovely?
L616093	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thanks.
L616092	u8465	m575	ANYA	We'll save you a place at our table.
L616091	u8467	m575	BRETT	Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
L615891	u8465	m575	ANYA	That's a date. 
L615890	u8467	m575	BRETT	I hope so.
L615886	u8467	m575	BRETT	Glad to see you again.
L615885	u8465	m575	ANYA	Good afternoon--
L615821	u8465	m575	ANYA	Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
L615820	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
L615817	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes, yes--the air--  --I'm getting plenty of air.  Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
L615816	u8465	m575	ANYA	Feeling a little better, I see.
L615689	u8465	m575	ANYA	I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
L615688	u8467	m575	BRETT	I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
L616013	u8475	m575	SALLY	I think you do.
L616012	u8465	m575	ANYA	I don't understand.
L616011	u8475	m575	SALLY	You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
L616010	u8465	m575	ANYA	Sorry I can't return the compliment.
L616009	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
L615819	u8465	m575	ANYA	Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
L615818	u8475	m575	SALLY	How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
L616189	u8465	m575	ANYA	Where's Lother?
L616188	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	No-o!
L616187	u8465	m575	ANYA	No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
L616186	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Did you find it?
L616148	u8465	m575	ANYA	I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
L616147	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	You're lucky--out my way, in Montana, there's nothing else to do--
L616019	u8465	m575	ANYA	<U>Gladly</U>.
L616018	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Will you pardon me?
L615893	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
L615892	u8465	m575	ANYA	You'll excuse me. 
L615879	u8465	m575	ANYA	Isn't that interesting?
L615878	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
L615672	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	"Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--""Honest Jack""--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world."
L615671	u8465	m575	ANYA	Montana?
L615670	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
L616450	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Get moving--
L616449	u8466	m575	BALLINGER	Guess again, copper.
L616448	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
L616447	u8466	m575	BALLINGER	Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
L616446	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	What did you want a gun for?
L616445	u8466	m575	BALLINGER	Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
L616444	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Where'd you get it?
L616377	u8467	m575	BRETT	"I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --""Honest Jack""! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets."
L616376	u8470	m575	LOTHER	And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
L616373	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a <U>rough</U> voyage.
L616372	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, no--I played with <U>your</U> cards--in <U>your</U> cabin--at <U>your</U> suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
L616371	u8470	m575	LOTHER	In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
L616368	u8467	m575	BRETT	I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would--  --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
L616367	u8470	m575	LOTHER	No gentleman would do that.
L616352	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure!  Excuse me.
L616351	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Could I see you a minute?
L616088	u8467	m575	BRETT	Fine--I'll be glad to.
L616087	u8470	m575	LOTHER	How about a little game later?
L615925	u8467	m575	BRETT	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
L615924	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You're coming back--
L615915	u8470	m575	LOTHER	And me coming in with two pair-- 
L615914	u8467	m575	BRETT	Aces full.
L615911	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll bet a couple of hundred.
L615910	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three. 
L615903	u8470	m575	LOTHER	If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink. 
L615902	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
L615897	u8467	m575	BRETT	Not at all.
L615896	u8470	m575	LOTHER	We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
L615693	u8470	m575	LOTHER	We'll be expecting you.
L615692	u8467	m575	BRETT	Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
L616523	u8475	m575	SALLY	What's the matter?
L616522	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, I'll be--!!!
L616521	u8475	m575	SALLY	Jimmy!
L616520	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.

L616424	u8475	m575	SALLY	Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
L616423	u8467	m575	BRETT	Make it five.

L616309	u8467	m575	BRETT	Come on--let's take a swim.
L616308	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
L616307	u8467	m575	BRETT	You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
L616306	u8475	m575	SALLY	He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
L616305	u8467	m575	BRETT	You can live that down, can't you?
L616304	u8475	m575	SALLY	Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
L616303	u8467	m575	BRETT	What do you know about them?
L616302	u8475	m575	SALLY	That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
L616301	u8467	m575	BRETT	Lose?--I won a little--
L616300	u8475	m575	SALLY	Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
L616299	u8467	m575	BRETT	A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
L616298	u8475	m575	SALLY	Who with?
L616297	u8467	m575	BRETT	Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
L616296	u8475	m575	SALLY	How well do you know her?
L616295	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes--I remember--
L616294	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
L616293	u8475	m575	SALLY	I could see you were pining away--
L616235	u8475	m575	SALLY	Good night, idiot!
L616234	u8467	m575	BRETT	Good night, Mrs. Brett!
L616221	u8475	m575	SALLY	I think we ought to walk.
L616220	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
L616219	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
L616218	u8467	m575	BRETT	You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
L616217	u8475	m575	SALLY	I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
L616216	u8467	m575	BRETT	I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
L616215	u8475	m575	SALLY	What?--
L616214	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
L616213	u8475	m575	SALLY	What, again?
L616201	u8475	m575	SALLY	We'll let it go at that--
L616200	u8467	m575	BRETT	Lonesome?
L616199	u8475	m575	SALLY	This time I'm really glad you showed up.
L616198	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
L616197	u8467	m575	BRETT	Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
L616077	u8467	m575	BRETT	You said it! How about a little action?
L616076	u8475	m575	SALLY	Don't let's talk about it.
L616075	u8467	m575	BRETT	You mean that?
L616074	u8475	m575	SALLY	Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
L616073	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sally--!
L616072	u8475	m575	SALLY	--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
L616071	u8467	m575	BRETT	But--
L616070	u8475	m575	SALLY	Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
L616069	u8467	m575	BRETT	For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
L616068	u8475	m575	SALLY	Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
L616066	u8475	m575	SALLY	You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
L616065	u8467	m575	BRETT	I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
L616064	u8475	m575	SALLY	That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
L616063	u8467	m575	BRETT	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
L616062	u8475	m575	SALLY	What are you thinking?
L616061	u8467	m575	BRETT	Decent?  I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
L616060	u8475	m575	SALLY	Mighty decent of you, pal.
L616059	u8467	m575	BRETT	Anything I can do?  I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
L616058	u8475	m575	SALLY	Thanks.
L616057	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sorry.
L616056	u8475	m575	SALLY	A little.
L616054	u8475	m575	SALLY	I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
L616053	u8467	m575	BRETT	You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
L616052	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
L615844	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'll be there--Good-by.
L615843	u8467	m575	BRETT	See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
L615835	u8475	m575	SALLY	Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
L615834	u8467	m575	BRETT	Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
L615833	u8475	m575	SALLY	Okay.
L615832	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sooner it you like.
L615831	u8475	m575	SALLY	At seven-thirty?
L615830	u8467	m575	BRETT	When?
L615829	u8475	m575	SALLY	But I'll have cocktails with you.
L615828	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't rub it in.
L615827	u8475	m575	SALLY	Well, I can't.
L615826	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes?
L615825	u8475	m575	SALLY	You asked me to dine with you tonight.
L615824	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't be a c-a-t.
L615823	u8475	m575	SALLY	Very--your mother?
L615822	u8467	m575	BRETT	Isn't she attractive?
L615808	u8467	m575	BRETT	--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
L615807	u8475	m575	SALLY	A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
L615806	u8467	m575	BRETT	Tell me.
L615805	u8475	m575	SALLY	What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
L615804	u8467	m575	BRETT	I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
L615803	u8475	m575	SALLY	Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
L615802	u8467	m575	BRETT	Married?
L615801	u8475	m575	SALLY	Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
L615800	u8467	m575	BRETT	You know, you're not a <U>bad</U>-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
L615799	u8467	m575	BRETT	Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
L615798	u8475	m575	SALLY	You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
L615797	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
L615769	u8475	m575	SALLY	Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
L615768	u8467	m575	BRETT	Brett is the name.
L615767	u8475	m575	SALLY	This is Mr.--er--
L615762	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well--breakfast?  Lunch?
L615761	u8475	m575	SALLY	Never eat before the show.
L615760	u8467	m575	BRETT	Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
L615759	u8475	m575	SALLY	You work too fast for me, young man.
L615758	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, yes, I am, because <U>afterwards</U>--up here in the moonlight.
L615757	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're not very ambitious, are you?
L615756	u8467	m575	BRETT	This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
L615706	u8467	m575	BRETT	Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
L615705	u8475	m575	SALLY	--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
L615704	u8467	m575	BRETT	There's soft music--
L615703	u8475	m575	SALLY	Good-by!
L615702	u8467	m575	BRETT	Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
L615701	u8475	m575	SALLY	Good-by.
L615700	u8467	m575	BRETT	How about giving me another coat?
L615699	u8475	m575	SALLY	So you washed it off!
L615698	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
L615697	u8475	m575	SALLY	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
L615696	u8467	m575	BRETT	Where have you been hiding?
L615478	u8467	m575	BRETT	No! Don't touch it! I want the <U>world</U> to see my <U>shame</U>.
L615477	u8475	m575	SALLY	--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
L615476	u8467	m575	BRETT	I could stand some more--
L615475	u8475	m575	SALLY	You've got lipstick all over you.
L615474	u8467	m575	BRETT	Very much--
L615473	u8475	m575	SALLY	Like her paint job?
L615472	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yes--
L615471	u8475	m575	SALLY	Nice lines--
L615470	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll say she is!
L615469	u8475	m575	SALLY	She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful. 
L615468	u8467	m575	BRETT	I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
L615467	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes--are you?
L615466	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
L615465	u8475	m575	SALLY	I thought you were one of my friends.
L615464	u8467	m575	BRETT	Want to take it back?
L615463	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm so sorry!
L616508	u8467	m575	BRETT	Get it!
L616507	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	On the drunk.
L616506	u8467	m575	BRETT	Where did you hide it?
L616505	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
L616504	u8467	m575	BRETT	Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
L616503	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
L616268	u8467	m575	BRETT	See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
L616267	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Say--wait a minute!
L616266	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
L616265	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	<U>Me</U>!
L616264	u8467	m575	BRETT	You keep it-- 
L615934	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
L615933	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Partners, ain't we?
L615932	u8467	m575	BRETT	About sixteen hundred.
L615923	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, is she? What a shame!  You'll pardon me?
L615922	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
L615921	u8467	m575	BRETT	What is it?
L615920	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
L615908	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll take one. 
L615907	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Thank you, sir. 
L615906	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
L615905	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
L615884	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
L615883	u8467	m575	BRETT	Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
L615876	u8467	m575	BRETT	That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
L615875	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
L615874	u8467	m575	BRETT	They won't squawk--they're professionals.
L615858	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
L615857	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You take some awful chances.
L615856	u8467	m575	BRETT	Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
L615855	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
L615854	u8467	m575	BRETT	I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
L615853	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Are you screwy?
L615852	u8467	m575	BRETT	Inspector McKinney.
L615577	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Now you're talkin'!
L615576	u8467	m575	BRETT	Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
L615575	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
L615574	u8467	m575	BRETT	Shortie!--you know my motto?
L615569	u8467	m575	BRETT	A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
L615568	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Change?
L615567	u8467	m575	BRETT	My change.
L615566	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	No, sir?
L615565	u8467	m575	BRETT	Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
L615561	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why <U>didn't</U> I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
L615560	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
L615559	u8467	m575	BRETT	She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
L615558	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	This is a business trip!
L615557	u8467	m575	BRETT	A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
L615556	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	--there's thousands of 'em!
L615555	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, Shortie!--  --there's a girl on this ship--
L615554	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
L615553	u8467	m575	BRETT	Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
L615552	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
L615551	u8467	m575	BRETT	Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
L615550	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Not a chance.
L615549	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
L615548	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	A dollar forty.
L615547	u8467	m575	BRETT	How're the tips?
L615546	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
L615545	u8467	m575	BRETT	Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
L615544	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
L615448	u8467	m575	BRETT	Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
L615447	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You don't think--?
L615440	u8467	m575	BRETT	Shortie, look!
L615439	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
L615435	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
L615434	u8467	m575	BRETT	Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
L615427	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	I'll watch for him, sir.
L615426	u8467	m575	BRETT	He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
L615425	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
L615424	u8467	m575	BRETT	Nix, the law!
L615423	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	I'll give you half of it.  Here's seventy cents. 
L615422	u8467	m575	BRETT	No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
L615421	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
L615420	u8467	m575	BRETT	It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
L615419	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
L615418	u8467	m575	BRETT	No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
L615417	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	We coulda got two third-class!
L615416	u8467	m575	BRETT	We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
L615415	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
L615414	u8467	m575	BRETT	I thought you were a smart guy.
L615413	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
L615412	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
L615411	u8467	m575	BRETT	Not here--follow me around the shed.
L616375	u8467	m575	BRETT	Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
L616374	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	That goes two ways.
L616370	u8467	m575	BRETT	Think again--
L616369	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	I thought you were a sucker--
L616366	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why isn't that a good time to quit?
L616365	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
L616364	u8467	m575	BRETT	Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
L616086	u8467	m575	BRETT	Much better--thank you--
L616085	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	How's your mother feeling?
L615918	u8467	m575	BRETT	It's a pleasure.
L615917	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	It's your deal.
L615901	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	That beats two Pairs. I'm glad <U>I</U> didn't win the first pot. Take the money, Mr. Brett.
L615900	u8467	m575	BRETT	Three Jacks.
L615899	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Don't worry about that.  We'll settle after the hand. Out in Montana where I come from a man's word is all that's necessary. What have you got?
L615898	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'll bet a couple of hundred--  I wonder what's keeping that boy.
L615881	u8467	m575	BRETT	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
L615880	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Come in! 
L616527	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Thanks. That makes us square.
L616526	u8467	m575	BRETT	Here's your fifty.
L616485	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why, I--
L616484	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
L616476	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
L616475	u8467	m575	BRETT	Don't get yourself all worked up--
L616464	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
L616463	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
L616350	u8467	m575	BRETT	Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
L616349	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
L616346	u8467	m575	BRETT	It's a bet--come on, Sally!
L616345	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
L616273	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
L616272	u8467	m575	BRETT	Coming to the pool for a swim?
L616271	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Hello, young fellow!
L616249	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string.  See what I mean, Purser?
L616248	u8467	m575	BRETT	Hey!--you're tickling me.
L616247	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
L616246	u8467	m575	BRETT	How about trying your fine Italian hand?
L616245	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
L616243	u8467	m575	BRETT	Swell!
L616242	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I'll go with you.
L616241	u8467	m575	BRETT	Sure, I'll go.
L616240	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
L616239	u8467	m575	BRETT	Why?
L616238	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
L616237	u8467	m575	BRETT	No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
L616236	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	How about you?
L616231	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
L616230	u8467	m575	BRETT	Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
L616183	u8467	m575	BRETT	Good night!
L616182	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
L616181	u8467	m575	BRETT	I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
L616177	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I wouldn't be surprised--
L616176	u8467	m575	BRETT	If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
L616175	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
L616174	u8467	m575	BRETT	It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
L616173	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
L616172	u8467	m575	BRETT	This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
L616146	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
L616145	u8467	m575	BRETT	Care to join us?
L616110	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I'll go with you--
L616109	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'm going to the show--
L615774	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	No--not quite.
L615773	u8467	m575	BRETT	Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
L615772	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Before that. Your face is very familiar.
L615771	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, yes. On the pier.
L615770	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
L616502	u8469	m575	DENBY	If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard-- 
L616501	u8467	m575	BRETT	What's that?
L616500	u8469	m575	DENBY	O.K., kid--  I'm only sorry for one thing.
L616499	u8467	m575	BRETT	Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
L616498	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
L616497	u8467	m575	BRETT	She did?
L616496	u8469	m575	DENBY	I won't--I'll ask for one right now.  Sally tells me she's in love with you.
L616047	u8469	m575	DENBY	Good!  At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
L616046	u8467	m575	BRETT	I should say not.
L616045	u8469	m575	DENBY	I don't know what it is, but I won't use it.  Is she entertaining you?
L615989	u8469	m575	DENBY	I would--but our rehearsal starts right away.  Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
L615988	u8467	m575	BRETT	She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
L615987	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
L615986	u8467	m575	BRETT	Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
L615840	u8469	m575	DENBY	Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
L615839	u8467	m575	BRETT	Wait a minute--let's match for it.
L615838	u8469	m575	DENBY	That's all right. I'll attend to this.
L615786	u8469	m575	DENBY	I'm sorry to hear that.
L615785	u8467	m575	BRETT	I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
L615784	u8469	m575	DENBY	That's too bad.
L615781	u8469	m575	DENBY	O.K. Heads you win.
L615780	u8467	m575	BRETT	Tell you what I'll do.  I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
L615779	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
L615776	u8467	m575	BRETT	Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
L615775	u8469	m575	DENBY	Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
L615753	u8468	m575	DAN	Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
L615752	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
L615751	u8468	m575	DAN	Sure.
L615750	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
L615749	u8468	m575	DAN	O.K.! Send that!
L615748	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
L615747	u8468	m575	DAN	June? That's my wife's name.
L615746	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Fine! Instead of saying ""next month""--we'll use one word and say ""June."""
L615745	u8468	m575	DAN	Next month is June.
L615744	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Wait a minute--What <U>is</U> next month?
L615743	u8468	m575	DAN	Send that.
L615742	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Now we get it down to two words--""next month."""
L615741	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Cut it out.
L615740	u8468	m575	DAN	Sure.
L615739	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615738	u8468	m575	DAN	Back is in New York.
L615737	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Just a minute--I don't think we need the word ""Back"" --Where <U>is</U> ""Back""?"
L615736	u8468	m575	DAN	Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
L615735	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  ""Back in four weeks."" Instead of ""in four weeks""--say ""next month""--That saves another word."
L615734	u8468	m575	DAN	That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
L615733	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks. You don't need the ""will be."" Just say ""Back in four weeks."""
L615732	u8468	m575	DAN	How?
L615731	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
L615730	u8468	m575	DAN	That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
L615729	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Will be back in four weeks--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
L615728	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
L615727	u8468	m575	DAN	Sure.
L615726	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Your wife knows that, don't she?
L615725	u8468	m575	DAN	In New York.
L615724	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Where do you live?
L615723	u8468	m575	DAN	How?
L615722	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
L615717	u8468	m575	DAN	What'll I say?
L615716	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Here you are, sir. 
L616341	u8469	m575	DENBY	All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
L616340	u8468	m575	DAN	I was never stiffer in my life.
L616339	u8469	m575	DENBY	Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
L616338	u8468	m575	DAN	Who won?
L616337	u8469	m575	DENBY	Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.
L615719	u8468	m575	DAN	That's fine.
L615718	u8469	m575	DENBY	Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
L615715	u8468	m575	DAN	She's in New York.
L615714	u8469	m575	DENBY	Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
L615713	u8468	m575	DAN	That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
L615712	u8469	m575	DENBY	This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
L615711	u8468	m575	DAN	Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
L615710	u8469	m575	DENBY	Well, did you find me?
L615709	u8468	m575	DAN	Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
L615708	u8469	m575	DENBY	I thought I put you to bed.
L615707	u8468	m575	DAN	Hello, Denby!
L615530	u8468	m575	DAN	<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
L615529	u8469	m575	DENBY	I can see where I won't talk much to you.
L615526	u8468	m575	DAN	So what?
L615525	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes--Me--in person!
L615524	u8468	m575	DAN	Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
L615523	u8469	m575	DENBY	That's me!
L615520	u8468	m575	DAN	I can see you're no gentleman--
L615519	u8469	m575	DENBY	Knots!
L615518	u8468	m575	DAN	What?
L615517	u8469	m575	DENBY	No. <U>Knots</U>!
L615516	u8468	m575	DAN	Pretty good--thirty <U>miles</U> an hour--
L615515	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
L615514	u8468	m575	DAN	I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
L615982	u8471	m575	MARY	Never mind.
L615981	u8468	m575	DAN	Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
L615980	u8471	m575	MARY	Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
L615979	u8468	m575	DAN	That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
L615978	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, there you are--
L615522	u8468	m575	DAN	<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
L615521	u8471	m575	MARY	He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
L616483	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes!
L616482	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Is this your gun?
L616481	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
L616480	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
L616479	u8469	m575	DENBY	I didn't--
L616283	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Yeah--
L616282	u8469	m575	DENBY	Maybe he just travels in bad company.
L616281	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
L616280	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
L616279	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
L616278	u8469	m575	DENBY	I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
L616277	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
L616276	u8469	m575	DENBY	Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
L615849	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Oh no--I don't want to impose on you--  It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it- 
L615848	u8469	m575	DENBY	It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
L615847	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
L615846	u8469	m575	DENBY	It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
L615845	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
L615815	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
L615814	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
L615811	u8469	m575	DENBY	Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
L615810	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
L615809	u8469	m575	DENBY	Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket--  What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
L615766	u8469	m575	DENBY	Miss Marsh.
L615765	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	McKinney's the name.
L616402	u8469	m575	DENBY	Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
L616401	u8475	m575	SALLY	Why--don't you like him?
L616400	u8475	m575	SALLY	Very--
L616399	u8469	m575	DENBY	Very serious?
L616398	u8475	m575	SALLY	Yes.
L615793	u8469	m575	DENBY	<U>He</U> does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
L615792	u8475	m575	SALLY	I don't get the humor of that remark.
L615791	u8469	m575	DENBY	What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
L615790	u8475	m575	SALLY	You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
L615622	u8469	m575	DENBY	Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
L615621	u8475	m575	SALLY	Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
L615620	u8469	m575	DENBY	I'll never love anybody else.
L615619	u8475	m575	SALLY	Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
L615618	u8469	m575	DENBY	But not nice enough to marry--eh?
L615617	u8475	m575	SALLY	Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
L615616	u8469	m575	DENBY	Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
L615615	u8475	m575	SALLY	Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
L615614	u8469	m575	DENBY	I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
L615613	u8475	m575	SALLY	I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
L615612	u8469	m575	DENBY	I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
L615611	u8475	m575	SALLY	It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
L615610	u8469	m575	DENBY	News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
L615609	u8475	m575	SALLY	You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
L615608	u8469	m575	DENBY	Do what--
L615607	u8475	m575	SALLY	I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
L615606	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
L615605	u8475	m575	SALLY	Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
L615604	u8469	m575	DENBY	No--not much--excepting-- 
L615603	u8475	m575	SALLY	You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
L615602	u8469	m575	DENBY	Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
L615601	u8475	m575	SALLY	And you've put it over--haven't you?
L615600	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
L615599	u8475	m575	SALLY	Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
L615598	u8469	m575	DENBY	Like it?
L615597	u8475	m575	SALLY	Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
L615596	u8475	m575	SALLY	Just what the doctor ordered.
L615595	u8469	m575	DENBY	Everything O.K.?
L615594	u8475	m575	SALLY	Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here. 
L615593	u8469	m575	DENBY	You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
L615592	u8475	m575	SALLY	Am I a member of this club?
L615395	u8475	m575	SALLY	Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
L615394	u8469	m575	DENBY	Are you happy?
L615393	u8475	m575	SALLY	Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
L616411	u8469	m575	DENBY	You don't shoot squirrels.
L616410	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Meaning what?
L616409	u8469	m575	DENBY	I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
L616408	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
L616407	u8469	m575	DENBY	Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
L616406	u8470	m575	LOTHER	What do you mean?
L616405	u8469	m575	DENBY	I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
L616533	u8469	m575	DENBY	Good-night, folks.
L616532	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
L616123	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
L616122	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
L615984	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
L615983	u8469	m575	DENBY	H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
L615513	u8469	m575	DENBY	"No--He's probably one of the ""Here's How.""  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--"
L615512	u8471	m575	MARY	Is that one of the Who's Who?
L615511	u8469	m575	DENBY	Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
L615510	u8471	m575	MARY	Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
L615509	u8469	m575	DENBY	All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
L615508	u8471	m575	MARY	Get that out of your trunk.
L615507	u8469	m575	DENBY	So what?
L615506	u8471	m575	MARY	--And he has sex appeal.
L615505	u8469	m575	DENBY	So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
L615504	u8471	m575	MARY	Well, he has a straw hat--
L615503	u8469	m575	DENBY	What's he got that I haven't got?
L615502	u8471	m575	MARY	Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
L615501	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
L615500	u8471	m575	MARY	With your dry wit and humor--
L615352	u8469	m575	DENBY	Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
L615351	u8471	m575	MARY	When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
L615350	u8469	m575	DENBY	All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
L615349	u8471	m575	MARY	I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
L615348	u8469	m575	DENBY	Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
L615347	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
L615345	u8469	m575	DENBY	Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
L615344	u8471	m575	MARY	Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
L615343	u8469	m575	DENBY	H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
L615342	u8471	m575	MARY	I'm getting seasick--
L615341	u8469	m575	DENBY	What's the matter, Mary?
L615340	u8471	m575	MARY	But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
L615339	u8469	m575	DENBY	Very good, Mary--
L615338	u8471	m575	MARY	Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
L615337	u8469	m575	DENBY	Well, let's hear the poem--
L615336	u8471	m575	MARY	Somebody's got to do it--
L615335	u8469	m575	DENBY	But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
L615334	u8471	m575	MARY	I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
L615333	u8469	m575	DENBY	Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
L616210	u8469	m575	DENBY	Easy kid--easy....  Come on--I want to talk to you.
L616209	u8473	m575	NED	Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
L616208	u8469	m575	DENBY	What for?
L616207	u8473	m575	NED	You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
L616206	u8469	m575	DENBY	What happened to you?
L615591	u8473	m575	NED	No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
L615590	u8469	m575	DENBY	Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
L615589	u8473	m575	NED	Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
L615588	u8469	m575	DENBY	"Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--""Gee you're tight.""-- and the window says--""You loosen up a bit and so will I.""--Good?--And then I do the one--  Oh--you don't like it, eh?"
L615929	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	It's a long trip and we'll get that sucker later.
L615928	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I went for four.
L615927	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	About twelve hundred.
L615926	u8470	m575	LOTHER	How much did you lose?
L615913	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
L615912	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
L615871	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Better unlock the door.  Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
L615870	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	The country boy's about due.
L615869	u8470	m575	LOTHER	The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
L615868	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
L615867	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Can you read 'em Jack?
L615680	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
L615679	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	That's him! That's the sucker!!
L615676	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	There's a lot of trout in this stream just waitin' for a fly.  I've already been workin' on a young fellow from Chicago--related to one of the big packin' families--on his way to Biarritz for a good time. Likes a little game of bridge and poker.
L615675	u8470	m575	LOTHER	"He works the boats as a ""come-on"" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself."
L615674	u8478	m575	SUMMERS	Eh?... Oh.
L615673	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
L616419	u8475	m575	SALLY	Not a chance--I'm through. 
L616418	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
L616196	u8470	m575	LOTHER	I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
L616195	u8475	m575	SALLY	Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
L616194	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
L616193	u8475	m575	SALLY	I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
L616192	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
L615999	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
L615998	u8475	m575	SALLY	Don't, Lee--that's dead.
L615997	u8470	m575	LOTHER	That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
L615996	u8475	m575	SALLY	--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
L615995	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
L615994	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
L615976	u8475	m575	SALLY	You can't bluff me any more.
L615975	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
L615974	u8475	m575	SALLY	Not because of Ned.
L615971	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
L615970	u8475	m575	SALLY	--you'd go with him!
L615969	u8470	m575	LOTHER	A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
L615968	u8475	m575	SALLY	You leave the kid alone.
L615967	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Thanks to me.
L615966	u8475	m575	SALLY	He's all right.
L615965	u8470	m575	LOTHER	That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire.  How about Ned?
L615964	u8475	m575	SALLY	You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
L615963	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
L615962	u8475	m575	SALLY	I wish I could.
L615961	u8470	m575	LOTHER	Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place.  I want you more now than I did that first night--  You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
L615960	u8475	m575	SALLY	Why don't you leave me alone?
L615959	u8470	m575	LOTHER	It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
L615958	u8475	m575	SALLY	I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
L615957	u8470	m575	LOTHER	You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
L615956	u8475	m575	SALLY	All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
L616478	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
L616477	u8473	m575	NED	I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
L616474	u8473	m575	NED	Because I was yellow, I guess--
L616473	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Why?
L616472	u8473	m575	NED	I wouldn't say that--  I'm glad he's dead--yes--I'd thought of killing him-- but I didn't--
L616471	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
L616470	u8473	m575	NED	No!
L616469	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
L616468	u8473	m575	NED	Yes, Yes!
L616529	u8475	m575	SALLY	He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
L616528	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
L616519	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
L616518	u8475	m575	SALLY	I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
L616517	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
L616462	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	For a very excellent reason from your own admission--  --I'm not saying you <U>did</U>--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
L616461	u8475	m575	SALLY	Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
L616460	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I sincerely hope so--
L616459	u8475	m575	SALLY	That's the truth--every single word!
L616361	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
L616360	u8475	m575	SALLY	Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
L616359	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
L616358	u8475	m575	SALLY	Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
L616357	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	I mean if you knew it were stolen.
L616356	u8475	m575	SALLY	"Say, ""Thanks very much!"""
L616355	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
L616354	u8475	m575	SALLY	Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
L616353	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Congratulations.
L616233	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Good night!
L616232	u8475	m575	SALLY	It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
L616258	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Nothin--  --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
L616257	u8474	m575	PURSER	What's the matter?
L616256	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
L616255	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	It all depends on what you're used to.
L616254	u8474	m575	PURSER	I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
L616253	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Smooth's the word.
L616252	u8474	m575	PURSER	He's certainly good-natured.
L615864	u8474	m575	PURSER	Thirty one's and two ten's?
L615863	u8472	m575	MCKINNEY	Thank you.
L615862	u8474	m575	PURSER	There you are, sir.
L616140	u8473	m575	NED	If he comes near you again, I'll break his neck--
L616139	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'll explain later--
L616138	u8473	m575	NED	What!--are you crazy?
L616137	u8475	m575	SALLY	I was in his cabin--
L616136	u8473	m575	NED	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
L616135	u8475	m575	SALLY	I'm all right.
L615941	u8475	m575	SALLY	Aren't the roses beautiful?
L615940	u8473	m575	NED	Sure, Sis.
L615939	u8475	m575	SALLY	Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
L615397	u8475	m575	SALLY	Do you think Lother could have seen it?
L615396	u8473	m575	NED	I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
L616330	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Because you ran after me.
L616329	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Then why did you run away?
L616328	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
L616327	u8477	m575	STEWARD	I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
L616326	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
L616317	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Hey--you! Where you going?
L616316	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Ain't got time.
L616315	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Let me look at it.
L616314	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Nothin'.
L615564	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
L615563	u8476	m575	SHORTIE	Telegrams.
L615562	u8477	m575	STEWARD	Everything in order, sir?  What are <U>you</U> doing here, my lad?
L660491	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
L660490	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
L660483	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L660482	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
L660481	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
L660477	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Yes, darling.
L660476	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
L660475	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
L660474	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
L659471	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
L659470	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!
L659442	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, you just help us out today, and find yourself a place where you won't get into any trouble.
L659441	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659440	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
L659439	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
L659385	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- all right.
L659384	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
L659383	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
L659382	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
L659379	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
L659378	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
L659377	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
L659376	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
L659375	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Aunt Em!
L659465	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
L659464	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Uhh -- yeah --
L659390	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659389	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Oh, I hope we got them in time.
L659388	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Yes.
L659387	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
L659386	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
L659431	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
L659430	u8952	m610	HICKORY	All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
L659429	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
L659428	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
L659427	u8948	m610	AUNT EM	Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
L659426	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
L659605	u8949	m610	BARRISTER	You'll be hist...

L660427	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
L660426	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
L660425	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
L660361	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh ....
L660360	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
L660357	u8964	m610	WIZARD	No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
L660356	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't believe you!
L660355	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uhhhh -- yes...
L659423	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm all right.  Oh -- I fell in and -- and Zeke --
L659422	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Are you all right, Dorothy?
L659421	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Zeke!  Help!  Help me, Zeke!  Get me out of here!  Help!
L659415	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now what happened? I'll bet Hunk did that.
L659414	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Hickory!
L659413	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Who did it? Now wait a minute.
L659412	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!
L659411	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't have no more dust storms. Can you imagine what it'll mean to this section of the country? I'll show you. It works perfectly now. Here's the principle. You see that fan -- that sends up air currents into the sky. These air currents -- Oh, stop it!
L659410	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	This?
L659409	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
L659408	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, gee, I try and have a heart.
L659407	u8952	m610	HICKORY	Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a poor sour-faced old maid that -- she ain't got no heart left. You know, you should have a little more heart yourself, and have pity on her.
L660212	u8963	m610	WITCH	Catch him, you fool!
L660211	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Run, Toto, run!
L660208	u8963	m610	WITCH	No!  Fool, that I am!  I should have remembered -- those slippers will never come off, as long as...
L660207	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
L660206	u8963	m610	WITCH	Ahh!  Ah!
L660205	u8963	m610	WITCH	That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
L660204	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
L660203	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
L660202	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
L660201	u8963	m610	WITCH	Certainly -- certainly -- when you give me those slippers.
L660200	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, please give me back my dog!
L660199	u8963	m610	WITCH	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
L660198	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
L659620	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!....
L659619	u8963	m610	WITCH	...didn't you?
L660472	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
L660471	u8951	m610	GLINDA	"And think to yourself -- ""There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."""
L660470	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
L660469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes, I'm ready now.
L660468	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Say goodbye, Toto.
L660467	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you ready now?
L660462	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- that's too wonderful to be true! Oh, it's -- it's going to be so hard to say goodbye.  I love you all, too.  Goodbye, Tin Man.  Oh, don't cry.  You'll rust so dreadfully.  Here -- here's your oil-can. Goodbye.
L660461	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Whenever you wish.
L660460	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now?
L660459	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Toto, too.
L660458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Toto, too?
L660448	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have?
L660447	u8951	m610	GLINDA	You don't need to be helped any longer. You've always had the power to go back to Kansas.
L660446	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, will you help me?  Can you help me?
L659644	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
L659643	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But, how do I start for Emerald City?
L659642	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, then, you'll have to walk.  The Munchkins will see you safely to the border of Munchkinland.  And remember, never let those ruby slippers off your feet for a moment, or you will be at the mercy of the Wicked Witch of the West.
L659641	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, I'm afraid I didn't.
L659640	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
L659639	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
L659638	u8951	m610	GLINDA	No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
L659637	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
L659636	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
L659615	u8951	m610	GLINDA	That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
L659614	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I thought you said she was dead.
L659565	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The little people who live in this land -- it's Munchkinland, and you are their national heroine, my dear.  It's all right -- you may all come out and thank her. It's all right now - you may all come out.
L659564	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.  But, if you please -- what are Munchkins?
L659563	u8951	m610	GLINDA	The Munchkins are happy because you have freed them from the Wicked Witch of the East.
L659557	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
L659556	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Toto's my dog.
L659554	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh!  Well....
L659553	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Who, me?  Why, I'm not a witch at all.  I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas.
L659552	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
L660489	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But you couldn't have been, could you?
L660488	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- 
L659533	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
L659532	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
L659531	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!
L659530	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you....
L659529	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
L659528	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- no!
L659527	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...bed.
L659526	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
L659525	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...paper?
L659524	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Has it poppies on the wall....
L659523	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...room --
L659521	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What's she doing now?
L659520	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Uh-huh.
L659519	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
L659517	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Me?
L659516	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Someone has hurt her -- someone has just about broken her heart.
L659515	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659514	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
L659513	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's right.  What's she doing?
L659512	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Her -- her name is Emily.
L659511	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...That's Aunt Em.
L659510	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	...her face is careworn.
L659507	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh -- yes.
L659506	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's our farm!
L659499	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
L659498	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
L659497	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659496	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, they won't - honestly.
L659495	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Aw, come, come, come --
L659494	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
L659493	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh --
L659492	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
L659491	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
L659488	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
L659487	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Yes --
L659486	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's just like you could read what was inside of me.
L659485	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	No, no --  now don't tell me.  They -- they don't understand you at home.  They don't appreciate you. You want to see other lands -- big cities -- big mountains -- big oceans --
L659484	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why --
L659483	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
L659482	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How did you guess?
L659481	u8958	m610	PROFESSOR	Let's see -- you're -- you're travelling in disguise. No, that's not right.  I -- you're -- you're going on a visit.  No, I'm wrong. That's...You're -- running away.
L659473	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Stop her!
L659472	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
L659469	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
L659468	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
L659467	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No --
L659466	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	Now you're seeing reason.
L659458	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
L659457	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
L660464	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --  Goodbye, Lion.  You know, I know it isn't right, but I'm going to miss the way you used to holler for help before you found your courage.
L660463	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now I know I've got a heart -- 'cause it's breaking.
L660405	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Look -- it ticks!
L660404	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L660403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes...!
L660402	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ahh --- Oh, it ticks!  Listen!
L660337	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	You've had plenty of time already!
L660336	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.
L660279	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I knew you would!
L660278	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Dorothy!
L660156	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
L660155	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Something bit me, too!
L660147	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh, Tin Man!   Oh!
L660146	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No.  Why only --  Oh --
L660070	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
L660069	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, he's just ascared again.
L659992	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659991	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Can't that female take no for an answer?
L659881	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'm sure he could give you some courage.
L659880	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And him a brain.
L659853	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It-it-it-it - it's a huge one!
L659852	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	What sort of an animal is that?
L659851	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And bears!
L659835	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659834	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	We might.
L659825	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
L659824	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
L659811	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh-oh-
L659810	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
L659809	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659808	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh! Oh!
L659807	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh - I'll get it!
L659806	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear. I don't know what I'd do if a whole swarm kept -- Oh! Oh! Oh, there's one on me!
L659805	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I - I guess they tried to, but they bent their stingers.
L659804	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
L659803	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh! They're - they're gone now.
L659793	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Ohh -- what's that? Oh --
L659792	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
L659791	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
L659788	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
L659787	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
L659786	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
L659785	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
L659778	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	All hollow.  Oh --
L659777	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659772	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --!
L659771	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
L659770	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, you're perfect now.
L659769	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
L659768	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was chopping that tree -- minding my own business -- when suddenly it started to rain....
L659767	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, goodness!  How did you ever get like this?
L659766	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No -- it feels wonderful.  I've held that axe up for ages.  Oh ---
L659765	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...Oh, did that hurt?
L659764	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh --
L659763	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh...
L659762	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
L659756	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	My mouth -- my mouth!
L659755	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Where do you want to be oiled first?
L659752	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oil can....
L659751	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Did you say something?
L659750	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oil can.....Oil can....
L659850	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my! 
L659849	u8961	m610	TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY	Lions and tigers and bears!
L659848	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my!
L659847	u8961	m610	TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY	Lions and tigers and bears!
L659846	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my!
L659845	u8961	m610	TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY	Lions and tigers and bears!
L659844	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my!
L659843	u8961	m610	TIN MAN -- SCARECROW AND DOROTHY	Lions and tigers and bears!
L659842	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, my!
L660466	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I think I'll miss you most of all.
L660465	u8954	m610	LION	Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.
L660444	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, that's very kind of you -- but this could never be like Kansas.  Auntie Em must have stopped wondering what happened to me by now.  Oh, Scarecrow, what am I going to do?
L660443	u8954	m610	LION	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
L660442	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, now I'll never get home!
L660409	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
L660408	u8954	m610	LION	...Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!
L660293	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh!
L660292	u8954	m610	LION	They're coming back!
L660277	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
L660276	u8954	m610	LION	Did they hurtcha?
L660275	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
L660166	u8954	m610	LION	I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
L660165	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
L660164	u8954	m610	LION	As Monarch of the Forest I don't like the situation.
L660160	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It may be just a cricket Or a critter in the trees.
L660159	u8954	m610	LION	That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
L660138	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L660137	u8954	m610	LION	No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
L660136	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Does it work?
L660121	u8954	m610	LION	Huh?  What'd he say?
L660120	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- Oh, come on.
L660077	u8954	m610	LION	Ohh!
L660076	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, come on.
L660075	u8954	m610	LION	Because I'm still scared!
L660074	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But why?  Why?
L660073	u8954	m610	LION	I'd sooner wait outside.
L660072	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
L660071	u8954	m610	LION	I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
L660043	u8954	m610	LION	I'd wrap him up in cellophant!
L660042	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Supposin' you met an elephant?
L660041	u8954	m610	LION	Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
L660040	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	How about a hippopotamus?
L660037	u8954	m610	LION	Not nobody, not nohow!
L660036	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
L660023	u8954	m610	LION	In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
L660022	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I'll be home in time for supper!
L660010	u8954	m610	LION	And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
L660009	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
L659990	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
L659989	u8954	m610	LION	Who's her?  Who's her?
L659986	u8954	m610	LION	Hah!
L659985	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
L659939	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Look!  He's rusted again.  Oh, give me the oil can -- quick!  Oh-oh, quick!
L659938	u8954	m610	LION	Oh -- unusual weather we're having, ain't it?
L659904	u8954	m610	LION	Yes.
L659903	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes -- let's run!
L659901	u8954	m610	LION	Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
L659900	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
L659894	u8954	m610	LION	The nerve.
L659893	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	A home --
L659887	u8954	m610	LION	Yeh, it's sad, believe me, Missy When you're born to be a sissy, Without the vim and verve. But I could show my prowess -- Be a lion not a mou-ess -- If I only had the nerve I'm afraid there's no denyin' I'm just a dande-lion -- A fate I don't deserve. I'd be brave as a blizzard --
L659886	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh.
L659885	u8954	m610	LION	...has been simply unbearable.
L659873	u8954	m610	LION	You're right -- I am a coward.
L659872	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Well, of course not.  My goodness, what a fuss you're making.  Well, naturally, when you go around picking on things weaker than you are -- Why, you're nothing but a great big coward!
L659871	u8954	m610	LION	Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
L659870	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
L659869	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, but you tried to.
L659868	u8954	m610	LION	What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.
L659425	u8953	m610	HUNK	What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
L659424	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
L659406	u8953	m610	HUNK	Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
L659405	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
L659404	u8953	m610	HUNK	Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
L659403	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I have so got brains.
L659402	u8953	m610	HUNK	Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your head about Miss Gulch.  Think you didn't have any brains at all.
L660304	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Help! I'm burning!  I'm burning!  I'm burning!  Help! Help! Help!
L660303	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
L660302	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	No -- No -- No -- No!
L660158	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Did you just hear what I just heard?
L660157	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, come on now - everybody -- 
L660149	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
L660148	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- Oh --
L660058	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- and I was so happy!  I thought I was on my way home!
L660057	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
L660056	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659999	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
L659998	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Dear, whatever shall we do?
L659943	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
L659942	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.
L659941	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
L659940	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- there --
L659937	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659936	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
L659914	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, no -- please.  I have to rest for just a minute.  Toto!
L659913	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...along.
L659879	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't see why not.  Why don't you come along with us?  We're on our way to see the Wizard now. To get him a heart.
L659878	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's too bad.  Don't you think the Wizard could help him, too?
L659833	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Do -- do you suppose we'll meet any wild animals?
L659832	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Of course, I don't know, but I think it'll get darker before it gets lighter.
L659831	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't like this forest!  It's -- it's dark and creepy!
L659823	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
L659822	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
L659819	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
L659818	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
L659790	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	And I'll keep the oil-can handy.
L659789	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But you've just been saying how much you want a heart.
L659760	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes --- there.
L659759	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	The other side....
L659758	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Here -- here --
L659757	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	He said his mouth.
L659754	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
L659753	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oil can what?
L659749	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Yes.  Oh -- look --
L659748	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What?
L659747	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
L659746	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh --
L659745	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  I guess that did it!  Help yourself.
L659735	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
L659734	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
L659726	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz!
L659725	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	To Oz?
L659724	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, I'll try!  Really, I will.
L659723	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- well -- you're not starting out very well.
L659722	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Hooray!  We're off to see a Wizard!
L659720	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
L659719	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I don't blame you for that.
L659718	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
L659717	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
L659716	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Yes -- that's true.
L659715	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	I couldn't say.  But even if he didn't, you'd be no worse off than you are now.
L659714	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Do you think if I went with you this Wizard would give me some brains?
L659713	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659712	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You're going to see a Wizard?
L659711	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
L659710	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Where's Kansas?
L659709	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Um-hmm.
L659708	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They would?
L659707	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
L659695	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
L659694	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Did I scare you?
L659693	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
L659692	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	...free!
L659691	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	My, it's good to be....
L659690	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohhh --
L659689	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
L659688	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh -- does it hurt you?
L659687	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Whhhooops!  Ha-ha -- there goes some of me again!
L659686	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Ohh!
L659685	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Ohhhh --
L659684	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...yes.
L659680	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, that's very kind of you -- very kind.
L659679	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
L659678	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
L659661	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It's pleasant down that way, too.
L659660	u8950	m610	DOROTHY	...don't talk.
L659632	u8963	m610	WITCH	Very well -- I'll bide my time -- and as for you, my fine lady, it's true, I can't attend to you here and now as I'd like, but just try to stay out of my way....
L659631	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
L659630	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
L659626	u8951	m610	GLINDA	It's too late!  There they....
L659625	u8963	m610	WITCH	The ruby slippers!  What have you done with them? Give them back to me, or I'll ---
L659623	u8963	m610	WITCH	The slippers -- yes.....the slippers!
L659622	u8951	m610	GLINDA	...ting the ruby slippers?
L659618	u8963	m610	WITCH	You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
L659617	u8951	m610	GLINDA	Leave her alone!
L659616	u8963	m610	WITCH	Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
L660422	u8954	m610	LION	It did?
L660421	u8964	m610	WIZARD	...excellence to the Miracle Wonderland Carnival Company -- until one day, while performing spectacular feats of stratospheric skill never before attempted by civilized man, an unfortunate phenomena occurred. The balloon failed to return to the fair.
L660415	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
L660414	u8954	m610	LION	Dorothy next!

L660384	u8964	m610	WIZARD	You do? boys, you're aiming low. You not only surprise, but you grieve me.
L660383	u8954	m610	LION	Real courage. That's what we want.
L660359	u8954	m610	LION	Yeah!

L660271	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Stop pushing!
L660260	u8954	m610	LION	Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
L660259	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on -- I've got another idea.
L660248	u8954	m610	LION	Now...
L660247	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Up!
L660240	u8954	m610	LION	All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
L660239	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	That's right.
L660238	u8954	m610	LION	I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?

L660233	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I've got a plan how to get in there.
L660189	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't stand there talking!  Put me together! We've got to find Dorothy!
L660188	u8954	m610	LION	They sure knocked the stuffings out of you, didn't they?
L660083	u8954	m610	LION	What was that?
L660082	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Here --   Come on.
L660081	u8954	m610	LION	I -- Oh --
L660080	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, you did it yourself!
L660079	u8954	m610	LION	Somebody pulled my tail.
L660078	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What happened?
L660068	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What's the matter?
L660067	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
L660062	u8954	m610	LION	I don't know.
L660061	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Who at?
L660060	u8954	m610	LION	Would...would it do any good if I roared?
L660045	u8954	m610	LION	I'd show him who was King of the Fores'!
L660044	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What if it were a brontosaurus?
L659925	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't you start it, too!
L659924	u8954	m610	LION	Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
L660379	u8954	m610	LION	Not nohow!
L660378	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	You don't get around us that easy!
L660270	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Don't push!

L660226	u8954	m610	LION	...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
L660218	u8954	m610	LION	Yeah --
L660217	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
L660192	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
L660191	u8954	m610	LION	Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
L660190	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
L660172	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Whozat?

L660134	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
L660039	u8954	m610	LION	Imposserous!
L660038	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Not even a rhinoceros?
L659920	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
L659919	u8954	m610	LION	Dorothy!
L659877	u8954	m610	LION	That doesn't do any good -- I'm afraid of 'em.
L659876	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Why don't you try counting sheep?
L659875	u8954	m610	LION	I haven't slept in weeks.

L659452	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
L659451	u8962	m610	UNCLE HENRY	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
L659450	u8956	m610	MISS GULCH	... about Dorothy.

L660243	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No, you don't.
L660231	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Don't cry now.  We haven't got the oil-can with us and you've been squeaking enough as it is.
L660230	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh, I hate to think of her in there.  We've got to get her out. 
L660224	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Come on, fellows!
L660223	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh --

L660195	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Oh, dear, dear.
L660194	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Now, now, don't fret.
L660193	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
L660187	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Well, that's you all over.
L660186	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	They tore my legs off, and they threw them over there! Then they took my chest out, and they threw it over there!

L660184	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!

L660167	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It's a whozis.
L660163	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.

L659892	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	A heart --
L659891	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Then I'm sure to get a brain --
L659889	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'd be clever as a gizzard --
L659888	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'd be gentle as a lizard --
L659837	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
L659836	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Animals that -- that eat straw?
L659829	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	To Oz!
L659828	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	To Oz?

L659820	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	No, sir!
L659802	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	I'll see you reach the Wizard, whether I get a heart of not.  Bee-hive -- bah!  Let her try and make a bee-hive out of me! You know -- Hmm? What's that?
L659801	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	I'm not afraid of her.  I'll see you get safely to the Wizard now, whether I get a brain or not!  Stuff a mattress with me! Hah!
L659774	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	It's empty. The tinsmith forgot to give me a heart.
L659773	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Beautiful!  What an echo!
L660392	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, you can't.  As for you, my fine friend -- you're a victim of disorganized thinking.  You are under the unfortunate delusion that simply because you run away from danger, you have no courage.  You're confusing courage with wisdom.  Back where I come from, we have men who are called heroes.  Once a year, they take their fortitude out of mothballs and parade it down the main street of the city.  And they have no more courage than you have.  But! They have one thing that you haven't got! A medal!  Therefore -- for meritorious....
L660391	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	How can I ever thank you enough?
L660388	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	Th.D.?
L660387	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
L660381	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	You promised us real things -- a real...
L660380	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well --
L660373	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660372	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
L660371	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660370	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
L660369	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Well, I --
L660368	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	What about us?
L660367	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes.
L660366	u8959	m610	SCARECROW	It makes you nervous?
L660365	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
L660436	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Help!
L660435	u8964	m610	WIZARD	-- Ruined my exit!
L660434	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
L660433	u8964	m610	WIZARD	This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
L660432	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	Stop that dog!
L660398	u8964	m610	WIZARD	Yes -- ....
L660397	u8960	m610	TIN MAN	But I still want one.
L660396	u8964	m610	WIZARD	As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
