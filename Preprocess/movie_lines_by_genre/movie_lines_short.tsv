L391793	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything.
L391792	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	You want to come inside?
L391791	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
L391790	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	Is there something else I can do for you?
L391789	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
L391788	u2127	m138	MARIAN	What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
L391787	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
L391786	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I'm just concerned about my daughter.
L391785	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	Who told you we deal drugs?
L391784	u2127	m138	MARIAN	And you don't deal drugs?
L391783	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	We like to think so, yeah.
L391782	u2127	m138	MARIAN	My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
L391781	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
L391780	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
L391754	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Have a nice day.
L391753	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	What happened?  Did you lose your keys?
L391752	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, let me get out of your way then.
L391751	u2126	m138	DISCIPLE PROSPECT	I just need to use the phone, lady.
L391750	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, please, don't hurt me.
L391862	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Goodbye, sweetheart.
L391861	u2130	m138	PAULA	Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
L391860	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Mm hmm.
L391859	u2130	m138	PAULA	I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
L391858	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I can make my own decisions.
L391857	u2130	m138	PAULA	Mother!
L391856	u2127	m138	MARIAN	At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
L391855	u2130	m138	PAULA	Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
L391854	u2130	m138	PAULA	I'd love to.
L391853	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
L391852	u2130	m138	PAULA	You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
L391851	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
L391850	u2130	m138	PAULA	I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
L391849	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Mm hmm.
L391848	u2130	m138	PAULA	It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
L391847	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I'm sorry.
L391846	u2130	m138	PAULA	Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
L391845	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Aaron?
L391844	u2130	m138	PAULA	You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
L391843	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, I hope so, dear.
L391842	u2130	m138	PAULA	No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
L391841	u2127	m138	MARIAN	If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
L391840	u2130	m138	PAULA	Mom, I need to talk to you.
L391834	u2130	m138	PAULA	No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
L391833	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
L391832	u2130	m138	PAULA	Mom ... I mean, it's amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
L391831	u2127	m138	MARIAN	What's wrong?
L391826	u2127	m138	MARIAN	My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
L391825	u2130	m138	PAULA	Mother, I ...
L391821	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
L391820	u2130	m138	PAULA	Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
L391737	u2130	m138	PAULA	That's not true.  Besides, I don't want you dusting.  I want you to see New York.
L391736	u2127	m138	MARIAN	You know, you never tell me anything.
L391735	u2130	m138	PAULA	I don't want to talk about it.
L391734	u2127	m138	MARIAN	He seemed quite taken with you.
L391733	u2130	m138	PAULA	I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
L391732	u2127	m138	MARIAN	But I was dusting.
L391731	u2130	m138	PAULA	Behind the books.
L391730	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Well, they were right out in plain view.
L391729	u2130	m138	PAULA	Mother!
L391728	u2127	m138	MARIAN	You know ...  ... whoops!
L391727	u2130	m138	PAULA	What pictures?
L391726	u2127	m138	MARIAN	What about the fellow in those pictures?
L391725	u2130	m138	PAULA	No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
L391724	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Dating anyone?
L391723	u2130	m138	PAULA	I'm good.
L391722	u2127	m138	MARIAN	How are you doing sweetheart?
L391721	u2130	m138	PAULA	That's why it's good you came to visit me.
L391720	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
L391714	u2130	m138	PAULA	I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
L391713	u2127	m138	MARIAN	The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
L391712	u2130	m138	PAULA	That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
L391711	u2127	m138	MARIAN	... What are they all doing there?
L391710	u2130	m138	PAULA	Uh-huh?
L391709	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
L391707	u2130	m138	PAULA	That's New York.  It looks rundown, but it's safe during the day.  You'll get used to it.
L391706	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Well, when I walked up the block, I ... well, my word!
L391705	u2130	m138	PAULA	You don't like where I live?
L391704	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
L391703	u2130	m138	PAULA	So, what do you think?
L391778	u2128	m138	MARIKA	... Manly?
L391777	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
L391775	u2128	m138	MARIKA	Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
L391774	u2127	m138	MARIAN	He's an organic farmer.
L391773	u2128	m138	MARIKA	What does he do?
L391772	u2127	m138	MARIAN	You know, you ought to come out to South Dakota some time and meet my son, Steve. He's single.
L391771	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
L391770	u2128	m138	MARIKA	What happened?
L391769	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh, it was such a big scandal.
L391768	u2128	m138	MARIKA	Really?
L391767	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
L391766	u2128	m138	MARIKA	And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
L391765	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Oh.  You need a cappuccino.
L391764	u2128	m138	MARIKA	I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night.
L391763	u2128	m138	MARIKA	Oh.  I thought today was Saturday.
L391762	u2127	m138	MARIAN	She's at work.  I'm her mother.
L391761	u2128	m138	MARIKA	It's Marika.  Is Paula there?
L391760	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Who is it?
L391693	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Thirty is base price.  Tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
L391692	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Forty-five?  I thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
L391691	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Forty-five all total.
L391690	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I see.  How much?
L391689	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
L391688	u2127	m138	MARIAN	This way?
L391687	u2129	m138	MISCHA	This is one-way street.  You go down the block to the middle.
L391684	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
L391683	u2127	m138	MARIAN	You mean it's dangerous?
L391682	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
L391681	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
L391680	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Moscow.
L391679	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
L391678	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Yeah.
L391677	u2127	m138	MARIAN	... And the children thought I should take a trip.
L391676	u2129	m138	MISCHA	... Oh ...
L391675	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
L391674	u2129	m138	MISCHA	So, you come here all by yourself?
L391673	u2127	m138	MARIAN	She would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, I guess no one drives here.
L391672	u2129	m138	MISCHA	And where is she?
L391671	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter.
L391669	u2127	m138	MARIAN	I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute.
L391668	u2129	m138	MISCHA	What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
L391667	u2127	m138	MARIAN	Are you sure you got my bag in?
L391666	u2129	m138	MISCHA	Where to?
L507931	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
L507930	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
L507929	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I am telling the truth.
L507928	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
L507927	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
L507926	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	Can you tell us why you were disposing of the body of a woman who didn't exist?
L507919	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Who?
L507918	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
L507917	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	"And this Mr. Hank Aleno who you talk so much about, a renowned failure, who also happens to be so conveniently dead -- perhaps the ""man"" you claim helped invent Simone is an invention himself?"
L507916	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Of course.
L507915	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
L507914	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Oh, no.  The fan club is real.  But they were worshipping computer code -- ones and zeros.
L507913	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	A fan club with a worldwide membership in the millions -- also bogus?
L507912	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
L507911	u2767	m181	DETECTIVE	-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
L507780	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Good-bye.
L507779	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'm glad we talked.
L507778	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
L507777	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Okay -- for you.
L507776	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
L507775	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing.  I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
L507774	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I don't know how many times I have to say this, Elaine, but Viktor and I are not in love.  I only make love to the camera.
L507773	u2768	m181	ELAINE	We have a daughter together.  I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
L507772	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
L507771	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
L507770	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
L507769	u2768	m181	ELAINE	My God, are you alright, Simone?
L507768	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I'm not --  He's not.
L507767	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
L507766	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
L507765	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
L507764	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
L507763	u2768	m181	ELAINE	No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
L507762	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
L507974	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No... it's life.
L507973	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
L507969	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
L507968	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"I was thinking -- what about you and... ""Simone"" moving back in with me and Lainey?"
L507967	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
L507966	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
L507965	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
L507964	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you!  I don't know how you did it but thank you.
L507907	u2768	m181	ELAINE	How can you bring that up at a time like this?
L507906	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
L507879	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
L507878	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
L507877	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
L507876	u2768	m181	ELAINE	How much wine have you had?
L507875	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
L507874	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
L507873	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- No, no, I didn't trip over her. You don't understand --
L507872	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
L507871	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
L507870	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You?
L507869	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not if I don't let her.
L507868	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
L507867	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.  She'll never work again -- retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.
L507866	u2768	m181	ELAINE	But you don't understand.  She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
L507865	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, I will end my relationship with her -- totally.
L507864	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
L507863	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
L507862	u2768	m181	ELAINE	That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
L507861	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
L507860	u2768	m181	ELAINE	This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
L507859	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I want you back too, Viktor.
L507858	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
L507857	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
L507856	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
L507855	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I just read somewhere --
L507854	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Impossible.
L507853	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
L507852	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not quite.
L507851	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Is Simone back to earth yet?
L507850	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
L507849	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	About now.  Would you like a drink?
L507848	u2768	m181	ELAINE	When is she coming over?
L507847	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	As a matter-of-fact I am.
L507846	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Is it Wednesday?  It's Wednesday. How embarrassing.  I don't know what I was thinking.  With all the excitement lately...  Am I interrupting something?  Are you expecting company?
L507845	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, it's Wednesday.
L507729	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I can imagine.
L507728	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
L507727	u2768	m181	ELAINE	... Simone.
L507726	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
L507725	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	My two favorite girls.
L507660	u2768	m181	ELAINE	It's a crowded summer.  We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get.  Good night, Viktor.
L507659	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Excuse me?  Start?
L507658	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
L507657	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I do?
L507656	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
L507655	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Do what?
L507654	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
L507653	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.
L507652	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, yes.  From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single.  Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight.  Intelligent, well informed, a natural.  And touching. She was spectacular.
L507651	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, of course not!  Why?  Would you care if we were?
L507650	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Are you and Simone...  ... getting married?
L507649	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.
L507648	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
L507603	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Oh, yes.  Of course.  Don't I always?
L507602	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
L507601	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
L507600	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Really?
L507599	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She said you were very beautiful.
L507598	u2768	m181	ELAINE	She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
L507592	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
L507591	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
L507590	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
L507589	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You're so good to protect her like this.
L507588	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She doesn't want pity.
L507587	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, you should have said something.
L507586	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	The premiere was the first time I've convinced her to venture out and it just confirmed her worst nightmares.
L507580	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear.  I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
L507579	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I can explain.
L507578	u2768	m181	ELAINE	So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
L507573	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"Not now.  She's emotional.  Her mother dies today.  Scene forty-two of ""Good For Nothing"".  It's not a good time."
L507572	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor.  If you can't handle her, I will.
L507561	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
L507560	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- You can't go in there!
L507502	u2768	m181	ELAINE	That's true.
L507501	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Everyone you know is lying.
L507500	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
L507499	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Soon.  Soon.
L507498	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'd love to tell her myself.  When are you going to let me meet her?
L507497	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
L507496	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
L507495	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You really think so?
L507494	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
L507493	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Better late than never.
L507492	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
L507486	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
L507485	u2768	m181	ELAINE	That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
L507484	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
L507479	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.  What did you think, Lainey?
L507478	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Stunning, Viktor.  The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
L507380	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
L507379	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Simone does not control my destiny.
L507378	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
L507377	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
L507376	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife.  Second ex-wife.  You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful.  We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
L507375	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'll walk you out.
L507374	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
L507373	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
L507372	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
L507371	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, shoot it on the last day.
L507370	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Even the fall from the plane.
L507369	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Even the fall from the plane?
L507368	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No need.  She does all her own stunts.
L507367	u2768	m181	ELAINE	There isn't one.
L507366	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What about it?
L507365	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"Well, we have to do something about this -- ""stuntwoman""."
L507364	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
L507363	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
L507362	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll send you her resume.
L507361	u2768	m181	ELAINE	She was in the theater?  When? Where?
L507360	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She'll do her own.  Theater training.
L507359	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Hair and make-up?
L507358	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She'll drive herself.
L507357	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
L507356	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	If it's on the page...
L507355	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
L507354	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... ""instrument""."
L507353	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
L507352	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Forever.
L507351	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"Viktor, we simply have to talk about ""Eternity..."""
L507348	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why not?
L507347	u2768	m181	ELAINE	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
L507346	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Sorry I didn't get her back in time.
L507218	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
L507217	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor, it's my studio.
L507216	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Out of the question.  A circus like that?
L507215	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
L507214	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	As I say, she's... something of a recluse.  That's how she's able to stay so pure -- by isolating herself in her art.
L507213	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Why not?
L507212	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't know if that's going to happen.
L507211	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I can't wait to meet her.
L507210	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Almost right.
L507209	u2768	m181	ELAINE	"I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  ""Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel""."
L507208	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
L507207	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
L507205	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
L507204	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Why isn't she with you?
L507203	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good to see you too, Elaine.
L507202	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Where is she?
L507085	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor.  If they're good, they get known.  And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse.  I'm sorry, Viktor.
L507084	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
L507083	u2768	m181	ELAINE	They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
L507082	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
L507081	u2768	m181	ELAINE	The picture's dead.
L507080	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
L507079	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
L507077	u2768	m181	ELAINE	How can I?  Your last three pictures tanked.  The board is giving me hell.  No bankable star will work with you after this.  If you just compromised... a little.
L507076	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You're not renewing my contract.
L507075	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this?  This is about investment and return.  Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
L507074	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Spare me.
L507073	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
L507072	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
L507071	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- It's called a projector.
L507070	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Well, I do remember why I started out in this business -- you seem to have forgotten -- working in New York with Cassevetes -- we were trying to do something important, shine a light in that darkened cinema --
L507069	u2768	m181	ELAINE	You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
L507068	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
L507067	u2768	m181	ELAINE	It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
L507066	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Please.
L507065	u2768	m181	ELAINE	The public decides who's on that list.
L507064	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Elaine, she doesn't have any children!  Don't you see?  We're being held hostage by 12 men and 5 women who someone somewhere has decreed are the A-list.
L507063	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- What's wrong with that?
L507062	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
L507061	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
L507060	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- overseeing the most cherished movie project of my career, am walking around with a pocketful of cherry Mike & Ike's?
L507059	u2768	m181	ELAINE	-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
L507058	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
L507057	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
L507056	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Do you know what these are, Elaine?
L507055	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Difficult.  I'm difficult.
L507054	u2768	m181	ELAINE	God, Viktor.  Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
L507053	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Excuse us.
L507052	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
L507049	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	We don't need a name.  We'll cast an unknown.
L507048	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Of course she is.  No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
L507761	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
L507760	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Where are you?
L507759	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
L507758	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
L507757	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Hello, is this Elaine?
L507756	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Hello?
L507951	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Listen to what you're saying, mom. Is there any evidence she is?
L507950	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
L507949	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- We don't believe daddy because we don't want to believe we were taken in too.
L507948	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Well, I --
L507947	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know it's embarrassing to admit it, mom, but when I think about it -- honestly, I haven't.  I mean, it feels like I have.  I know more about her than members of my own family.  She's even in my dreams. But I realized, going back through my diary, they were all TV appearances, near misses at parties, second-hand rumor, gossip on the internet.  I've never actually seen Simone up close, touched her, been in her physical presence.  Have you?
L507946	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I mean really meet her -- in the flesh.
L507945	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Of course.  What are you suggesting?
L507944	u2775	m181	LAINEY	So you did meet her?
L507943	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
L507942	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Because obviously she existed, right?
L507941	u2768	m181	ELAINE	God, it's so like your father.  Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore?  I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence.  I can never forgive that.
L507940	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Just a minute.
L507939	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
L507731	u2775	m181	LAINEY	It was a great show, Dad...
L507730	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Thank Simone for the tickets.
L507662	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
L507661	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Mom, do you miss Dad?
L507737	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I have to talk to her.
L507736	u2774	m181	KENT	Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
L507735	u2768	m181	ELAINE	Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
L507734	u2774	m181	KENT	Why?
L507733	u2768	m181	ELAINE	I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
L507097	u2768	m181	ELAINE	He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
L507096	u2774	m181	KENT	You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
L507477	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Please put your clothes on
L507476	u2769	m181	FAITH	Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?... Why are we here?  No why.  Just here.
L507475	u2769	m181	FAITH	Is that a problem?
L507474	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You're with me to be close to her?
L507473	u2769	m181	FAITH	Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
L507472	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Simone?
L507471	u2769	m181	FAITH	Yes, call me Simone.
L507470	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What I do to Simone?
L507469	u2769	m181	FAITH	Do what you do to Simone.
L507468	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What?... What did you say?
L507465	u2769	m181	FAITH	I do find myself physically attracted to you, Mr. Taransky.
L507464	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
L507463	u2769	m181	FAITH	... so much like her?
L507462	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You look so, so...
L507461	u2769	m181	FAITH	Of course.
L507460	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You understand you'll have to come back to my place to keep them off the, er...  ... scent.
L507459	u2769	m181	FAITH	No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
L507458	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
L507980	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	And what may I ask brought this on?
L507979	u2782	m181	SIMONE	That's true.  I can reveal that I am considering a career in politics.
L507978	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
L507977	u2782	m181	SIMONE	With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
L507976	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Frank, you know as well as I do, living in a fish bowl, the insatiable appetite of the media...
L507975	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	"-- Simone, the question on everyone's mind is simply... ""why?"""
L507642	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I suppose the thing I like most about the movies I'm in is that they're not about special effects.
L507641	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	What exactly was it that attracted you to your first two projects?
L507640	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Nudity has just never been an issue for me, Frank.  For me, clothes are just an option.
L507639	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	How about the nudity?
L507638	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Sure.  Where would you like to start?
L507637	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
L507636	u2782	m181	SIMONE	No, I'm okay.
L507627	u2782	m181	SIMONE	"That's a good question.  As Nietzsche said, ""Whenever a man strives long and hard to appear someone else..."""
L507626	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Who are you really?
L507625	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
L507624	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
L507623	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	You don't secretly want the attention?
L507622	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Don't I know it.  That's the only reason I'm here now -- to put the attention back where it belongs, on Mr. Taransky's film.
L507621	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Of course, the only problem with shying away from publicity these days is that it tends to attract more.
L507620	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
L507619	u2770	m181	FRANK BRAND	Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
L507530	u2771	m181	HAL	Simone!
L507529	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
L507527	u2771	m181	HAL	I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
L507526	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I know what you mean.
L507525	u2771	m181	HAL	You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
L507520	u2771	m181	HAL	Somebody said she was here.
L507519	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
L507518	u2771	m181	HAL	Is she here?
L507429	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I can't explain it to you now -- you'll see when it's all put together.  Anyway, we got it a couple of takes ago.  Let's move on.
L507428	u2771	m181	HAL	How did the wall get there?
L507427	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
L507426	u2771	m181	HAL	-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
L507425	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	There's... a wall between you --
L507424	u2771	m181	HAL	Why not?
L507423	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You can't.
L507422	u2771	m181	HAL	But she's right there!  I must feel her!
L507421	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Absolutely not!
L507420	u2771	m181	HAL	Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
L507419	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hal, what are you doing?
L507388	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
L507387	u2771	m181	HAL	For her?
L507386	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Body double.
L507385	u2771	m181	HAL	How will you do our love scenes?
L507303	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"You're so far off!  Hal... Hal Sinclair... your co- star.  Remember now?... No, I don't think he's put on weight.  Anyway, you think he's right for ""Eternity Forever""?... not the right type?... a different direction...  I'll try to talk her into it."
L507302	u2771	m181	HAL	It was more in passing.
L507301	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
L507299	u2771	m181	HAL	I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.  She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable.  I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
L507298	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Really?  She didn't mention it.
L507297	u2771	m181	HAL	Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
L507296	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Clyde.
L507295	u2771	m181	HAL	"And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read ""Eternity Forever"" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive."
L507294	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You never were together, Hal.
L507293	u2771	m181	HAL	The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
L507292	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hello, Hal.
L507291	u2771	m181	HAL	Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
L507047	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's a re-make, Hal.  Anders is not bigger than this picture.
L507046	u2771	m181	HAL	Nicola Anders is the only actress who can play that role.
L507135	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm already dead.
L507134	u2772	m181	HANK	I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
L507133	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
L507132	u2772	m181	HANK	I've seen every frame of your work. You're the only filmmaker in Hollywood with the artistic integrity to realize my vision. You and me, art and science... we are the perfect marriage.
L507131	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You saw that?
L507130	u2772	m181	HANK	Straw God changed my life.
L507129	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You do?
L507128	u2772	m181	HANK	An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
L507127	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What's that?
L507126	u2772	m181	HANK	That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
L507125	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't know anything about computers.
L507124	u2772	m181	HANK	It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
L507123	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
L507122	u2772	m181	HANK	You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
L507121	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- a living, breathing actor -- I can't work with a fake.
L507120	u2772	m181	HANK	-- Flesh is weak.
L507119	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I need flesh and --
L507118	u2772	m181	HANK	"-- We call them ""vactors""."
L507117	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Come on, Hank.  A synthespian, virtual actor -- ?
L507116	u2772	m181	HANK	Not like this --
L507115	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I've seen them all before.
L507114	u2772	m181	HANK	You have to see her.
L507113	u2772	m181	HANK	Don't be.  It was worth it.
L507112	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm sorry.
L507111	u2772	m181	HANK	Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
L507110	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good for you, Hank.
L507109	u2772	m181	HANK	-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
L507108	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
L507107	u2772	m181	HANK	"It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... ""Who Needs Humans?"""
L507106	u2772	m181	HANK	I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
L507105	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I was misquoted.
L507104	u2772	m181	HANK	I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
L507103	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You want me to call Security?
L507102	u2772	m181	HANK	I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
L507101	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Please, get away from me.
L507100	u2772	m181	HANK	-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
L507515	u2773	m181	HARRY	I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
L507514	u2780	m181	PREMIERE REPORTER 2	Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
L507513	u2773	m181	HARRY	We've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.
L507512	u2780	m181	PREMIERE REPORTER 2	"There's a rumor that you're more than just ""good friends""?"
L507511	u2773	m181	HARRY	I just came out to support my good friend, Simone.
L507510	u2780	m181	PREMIERE REPORTER 2	Harry!  Harry!  Can we have a minute?  What brings you here tonight?
L507972	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Your mistake wasn't making something fake, daddy.  We're fine with fake -- as long as you don't lie about it.
L507971	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Me and Simone.  What I did.
L507970	u2775	m181	LAINEY	About you and mom?
L507820	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Lainey...
L507819	u2775	m181	LAINEY	There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
L507818	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, that was me.
L507817	u2775	m181	LAINEY	The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
L507816	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
L507815	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.
L507814	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
L507813	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know.  Thank her for me.
L507812	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"It's the car she drove in ""Eternity Forever""."
L507811	u2775	m181	LAINEY	It's fantastic -- it's too much.
L507810	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
L507789	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She did... didn't she?
L507788	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Why didn't she thank you?
L507754	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I love you too, daddy.
L507753	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I love you, Lainey.
L507751	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
L507750	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
L507749	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
L507748	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
L507747	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
L507746	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
L507745	u2775	m181	LAINEY	She thinks you're with Simone.
L507744	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Really?  Too bad.
L507743	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
L507742	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I noticed.
L507741	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You know me -- married to my work.
L507740	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I do okay.  How about you?
L507739	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
L507490	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Night, Lainey.
L507489	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Good-night, Daddy.
L507488	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Precisely.
L507487	u2775	m181	LAINEY	So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
L507482	u2775	m181	LAINEY	No, not that.  I was just wondering -- in the bedroom scene in reel two why did Simone have no reflection when she walked in front of that mirror?
L507481	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
L507480	u2775	m181	LAINEY	One thing bothered me.
L507345	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I'm sure you'd tell me if you thought it was important.
L507344	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Exactly.  Don't you wonder where I'm really hiding Simone?
L507343	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- I know, I don't know anything.
L507342	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	If anyone asks about Simone --
L507341	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Okay, Dad.
L507327	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You understood them.  That's what was amazing.  It's a nice day.  Let's eat outside.
L507326	u2775	m181	LAINEY	You were the one who insisted on it.  Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
L507325	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You do?  Still?  I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
L507324	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I read.
L507323	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	How?
L507322	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I do.
L507321	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Okay.  But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
L507320	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
L507319	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
L507318	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know plenty of boys.
L507317	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
L507316	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Why?
L507315	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Can't you stop that?
L507185	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
L507184	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
L507183	u2775	m181	LAINEY	She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
L507162	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She can't watch herself.
L507161	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Is she here tonight?
L507160	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You know, I... don't know.
L507159	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
L507158	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Me too.
L507157	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
L507156	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	There was no other way.
L507155	u2775	m181	LAINEY	-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
L507154	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Not quite how I imagined it --
L507153	u2775	m181	LAINEY	This week anyhow.
L507152	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She still with Kent?
L507151	u2775	m181	LAINEY	"She's at the premiere of ""A Cold Day In Hell"".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions."
L507150	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Your mother couldn't make it?
L507149	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hello, Lainey.
L507148	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Hi, Dad.
L507094	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I know you'll do it, Dad.  You're Viktor Taransky.
L507093	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm going to finish the picture, sweetheart.  It's important.
L507091	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You look very grown up.  What are you doing?  You meeting your mom for dinner?
L507090	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Don't feel too bad.  Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her.  You're better off out of it.
L507089	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's really... not anything, Lainey.  It's just --
L507088	u2775	m181	LAINEY	I'm sorry Mom canned you.
L507087	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Hello, sweetheart.
L507086	u2775	m181	LAINEY	Hi, Dad.
L507957	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It was premeditated -- I knew exactly what I was doing!  I strangled her!  I bludgeoned her! I set her on fire!  I did it!  I killed her!
L507956	u2776	m181	LAWYER	What?!
L507955	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- No!  I can't go along with this horseshit!  Just tell them they can fry me!
L507938	u2776	m181	LAWYER	An insanity defence.
L507937	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
L507936	u2776	m181	LAWYER	You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
L507935	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I could get the death penalty.
L507934	u2776	m181	LAWYER	-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
L507809	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	This should take care of Mother.
L507808	u2777	m181	MAX	Don't you?
L507807	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You love her, don't you, Max?
L507806	u2777	m181	MAX	No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
L507805	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
L507804	u2777	m181	MAX	I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
L507803	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
L507802	u2777	m181	MAX	That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
L507798	u2777	m181	MAX	She hasn't uttered a word that whole time -- until she saw the big show.
L507797	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She looks a lot like you.
L507796	u2777	m181	MAX	I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
L507795	u2777	m181	MAX	Looks familiar, doesn't she?  No one comes from nowhere, Taransky. You turn over enough rocks...
L507794	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What now, Sayer?
L507699	u2777	m181	MAX	Er,... good.
L507698	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Alright, Sayer, you've got a deal.
L507697	u2777	m181	MAX	I want to see her.  Unless you show me Simone live and in person I show these pictures to the authorities.
L507696	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	What is it exactly you want, Sayer?
L507695	u2777	m181	MAX	I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
L507694	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Abduction?
L507693	u2777	m181	MAX	I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
L507692	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm keeping it in trust.
L507691	u2777	m181	MAX	"-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have ""obtained"" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her."
L507690	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- I bet you have.
L507689	u2777	m181	MAX	I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
L507688	u2777	m181	MAX	She was never in New Mexico.  She never left the studio.
L507687	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	The background is.
L507686	u2777	m181	MAX	It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
L507684	u2777	m181	MAX	I think you do.  I know it's a fake.
L507683	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I don't have time for this, Sayer.
L507682	u2777	m181	MAX	I know what you're up to.
L507681	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's a yacht.
L507680	u2777	m181	MAX	Nice boat, Taransky.
L507338	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
L507337	u2777	m181	MAX	Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
L507336	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm just trying to help you, Sayer. I don't want you to be disappointed.  It gets cold out here at night.
L507335	u2777	m181	MAX	The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
L507334	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	"Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of ""captive"" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops."
L507333	u2777	m181	MAX	She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
L507241	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Maybe the reason she's with me is a little thing called integrity, Sayer.  Look it up.
L507240	u2777	m181	MAX	So they're probably here.  You might be able to sell this 'disappearing act' to the rest of the world, but I'm not buying it. What's really behind this Simone woman?  The public has a right to know.  Why is she staying out of sight?  And why the hell is she with you?  I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Viktor, but you're not exactly Cecil B. DeMille -- more run-of-the-mill.
L507239	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	They are alive, Sayer.
L507238	u2777	m181	MAX	Our leaders aren't presidents anymore -- they're pop stars and screen idols.  If Woodward and Bernstein were alive today, they'd be right here in Hollywood with me.
L507237	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
L507236	u2777	m181	MAX	This is the story.
L507235	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
L507234	u2777	m181	MAX	Max Sayer -- National Echo.
L507233	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Do I know you?
L507670	u2778	m181	MILTON	Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
L507669	u2777	m181	MAX	I don't understand.
L507668	u2778	m181	MILTON	It's a hotel.
L507666	u2778	m181	MILTON	Is that why she left you?
L507665	u2777	m181	MAX	-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
L507609	u2778	m181	MILTON	We used to.
L507608	u2777	m181	MAX	-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
L507607	u2778	m181	MILTON	Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
L507606	u2777	m181	MAX	What do you want -- ?
L507605	u2778	m181	MILTON	Mr. Sayer...
L507559	u2777	m181	MAX	Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
L507558	u2778	m181	MILTON	Long live the First Amendment.
L507557	u2777	m181	MAX	Am I wasting my time with you? When she sues to protect her privacy, she'll have to appear in a public courtroom to do it.
L507556	u2777	m181	MAX	I will when you're finished writing it.
L507555	u2778	m181	MILTON	My God, you've got one?
L507554	u2777	m181	MAX	Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
L507553	u2777	m181	MAX	Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
L507552	u2778	m181	MILTON	Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
L507551	u2777	m181	MAX	Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
L507550	u2778	m181	MILTON	Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
L507549	u2777	m181	MAX	24-hour tail on Taransky?
L507548	u2778	m181	MILTON	We've got our best people on it, Mr. Sayer.
L507313	u2777	m181	MAX	Yes, very.
L507312	u2778	m181	MILTON	Dark?
L507311	u2777	m181	MAX	Whatever it is, it's dark.
L507310	u2778	m181	MILTON	Why?
L507309	u2777	m181	MAX	Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
L507308	u2778	m181	MILTON	Maybe he's talking to himself.
L507307	u2777	m181	MAX	Is it a jamming device?
L507837	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
L507836	u2779	m181	NICOLA	You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
L507835	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
L507834	u2779	m181	NICOLA	But that's Simone's part.
L507833	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You could play the lead.
L507832	u2779	m181	NICOLA	Thank you.
L507831	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.
L507829	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes, I'd like that.
L507828	u2779	m181	NICOLA	Would you like me to read?
L507827	u2779	m181	NICOLA	After I saw what Simone did with the role -- you know I fired all my people, went into rehab, took acting classes, changed my whole look.  She really inspired me.
L507826	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Thank you.  It's not important.
L507825	u2779	m181	NICOLA	"I never apologized properly for what happened on ""Sunrise""."
L507824	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes.
L507823	u2779	m181	NICOLA	A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
L507030	u2779	m181	NICOLA	"It wasn't working anyhow.  The scene with the thousand geese -- I don't understand this film.  I don't think anyone will understand it.  I already put out a press release -- citing ""creative differences""."
L507029	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
L507028	u2779	m181	NICOLA	I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
L507027	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
L507023	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Taller?  What?
L507022	u2779	m181	NICOLA	Taller, Viktor.
L507021	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	It's the biggest on earth!  I swear!  It's a 50-foot Airstream -- they don't make them any longer than that.
L507020	u2779	m181	NICOLA	It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
L507019	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
L507018	u2779	m181	NICOLA	You're in breach.
L507017	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
L507248	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
L507247	u2781	m181	SECURITY GUARD	What if it catches on fire?
L507246	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	She's already here.  She arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.  Remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.
L507245	u2781	m181	SECURITY GUARD	Is Miss Simone coming today?
L507244	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good.
L507243	u2781	m181	SECURITY GUARD	No one came in or went out just like you said, Mr. Taransky.
L507434	u2782	m181	SIMONE	-- What you don't understand --
L507433	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Let's take it down a notch.
L507390	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
L507389	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Simone, are you there?
L507284	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
L507283	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
L507282	u2782	m181	SIMONE	I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
L507269	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
L507268	u2782	m181	SIMONE	Hi.
L507442	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
L507441	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
L507281	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	I was hoping you'd say that.
L507280	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	"Not, ""Eternity Forever""?  The legendary unproduced script that was too good ever to get made?  I'd kill for that part."
L507279	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Speaking of which -- this is the project I'd like you to do next.
L507278	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
L507277	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You know what I'm talking about.
L507276	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	The only real truth is in the work.
L507275	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Are you ever going to tell the truth about me, Mr. Taransky?
L507274	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	See beyond that irrational allegiance to flesh and blood. -- See that with the rise in price of a real actor and the fall in price of a fake, the scales have tipped in favor of the fake.  -- See that if the performance is genuine, it doesn't matter if the actor is real.  Once a performance is committed to film, the blood and bones are gone anyway.  Only the spirit, the illusion remains. Besides, what's real anymore? These days most actors have digital work done to them so it's a gray area.
L507273	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
L507272	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
L507271	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
L507270	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You did create me.
L507264	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Yes.  Yes, it is.
L507263	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
L507261	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
L507260	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
L507259	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	I am the death of real.
L507258	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
L507257	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Maybe he can.
L507255	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
L507254	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	You mean they buy it?
L507253	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	... digitized.
L507252	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	A star is...
L507251	u2783	m181	SIMONE / VIKTOR	Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
L507250	u2784	m181	VIKTOR	Good morning, Simone.
L219215	u5330	m354	AARON	Alright.
L219214	u5334	m354	DONNA	Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
L219213	u5330	m354	AARON	I told you, no. I'm not that type.
L219212	u5334	m354	DONNA	Is it true?
L219211	u5330	m354	AARON	What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
L219210	u5334	m354	DONNA	There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
L219209	u5330	m354	AARON	Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
L219111	u5330	m354	AARON	Just get the fuck outta here.
L219110	u5334	m354	DONNA	God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
L219109	u5330	m354	AARON	Now she's tellin' me what the fuck to do.
L219107	u5330	m354	AARON	Then don't go out with me.
L219106	u5334	m354	DONNA	I wanna go out with you, I want to be part of your life. I want you to treat me the way a girlfriend should be treated.
L219105	u5330	m354	AARON	So get the fuck outta here.
L219104	u5334	m354	DONNA	Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
L219103	u5330	m354	AARON	Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
L219102	u5334	m354	DONNA	God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
L219101	u5330	m354	AARON	Not now, I'm busy
L219100	u5334	m354	DONNA	Why you have an attitude for?
L219099	u5330	m354	AARON	What?
L219098	u5334	m354	DONNA	Look at me.
L219097	u5330	m354	AARON	Fine.
L219096	u5334	m354	DONNA	Aaron, how you doin'?
L219095	u5330	m354	AARON	Don't fuck wit' me! Don't fuck wit' me.  My lawyer's so good he'll have you workin in Alaska, so dress warn.
L219287	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Oh, 'cause you got it like dat?
L219286	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I aint gotta prove nothin' to no girl, 'cause I got it like dat.
L219285	u5331	m354	AMANDA	No you didn't, you ain't provin'it.
L219284	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I kissed those girls.
L219283	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
L219282	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I did.
L219281	u5331	m354	AMANDA	See, I got you, you are so scared. I don't believe that you kissed no girls. That you got three girls and that you faithful and this and that.
L219280	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Good. I'm faithful to them.
L219279	u5331	m354	AMANDA	How you treat them?
L219278	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I buy them flowers.
L219277	u5331	m354	AMANDA	I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
L219276	u5338	m354	VICTOR	You look good.
L219275	u5331	m354	AMANDA	So what you think of me?
L219274	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Nah, we make out and stuff.
L219273	u5331	m354	AMANDA	That's it?
L219272	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Just chill.
L219271	u5331	m354	AMANDA	So wadda you do with your girls?
L219269	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
L219268	u5338	m354	VICTOR	You got a boyfriend?
L219267	u5331	m354	AMANDA	A play-ya.
L219266	u5338	m354	VICTOR	You know. I got a lot, more than one.
L219265	u5331	m354	AMANDA	So what's her name?
L219264	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Of course.
L219263	u5331	m354	AMANDA	So you got a girl?
L219262	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I just wanted to see you.
L219261	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Whadja wanna see me about?
L219260	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
L219259	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
L219258	u5338	m354	VICTOR	No.  What you do today?
L219257	u5331	m354	AMANDA	You know somebody around here?
L219256	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I, umm, came to see you.
L219255	u5331	m354	AMANDA	What are you doin' here?
L219254	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Nothin'.
L219253	u5331	m354	AMANDA	So watcha doin'?
L219252	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Um. Yeah! Shorty!
L219251	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Remember me, from the pool?
L219250	u5331	m354	AMANDA	Hi.
L219249	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Yo.
L219122	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Wussup.

L219032	u5334	m354	DONNA	Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.

L219030	u5334	m354	DONNA	Yeah, he got a bad attitude.

L219027	u5337	m354	MICHELLE	How does he look up close?
L219194	u5335	m354	HECTOR	I suggest you turn around and go back to where you came from.
L219193	u5338	m354	VICTOR	She didn't say she had no man.
L219192	u5335	m354	HECTOR	Yo, that's my girl.
L219191	u5338	m354	VICTOR	She's like this high, dark hair, skinny

L219188	u5335	m354	HECTOR	Who?

L219219	u5338	m354	VICTOR	No.
L219182	u5336	m354	JENETTE	Nothing.
L219181	u5338	m354	VICTOR	What?
L219180	u5336	m354	JENETTE	Probably.  One of the many.
L219179	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
L219178	u5336	m354	JENETTE	How do I know you're not lying.
L219177	u5338	m354	VICTOR	I'm a good friend of hers.
L219176	u5336	m354	JENETTE	So what do you want with her anyway?
L219175	u5338	m354	VICTOR	Didn't I see you at Pitt yesterday?
L219174	u5336	m354	JENETTE	Your friend must be misinformed.
L219173	u5338	m354	VICTOR	My friend told me she lived around here.
L219172	u5336	m354	JENETTE	Positive.
L219171	u5338	m354	VICTOR	You sure?
L219170	u5336	m354	JENETTE	Positive.
L219169	u5338	m354	VICTOR	You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
L456403	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Yes....
L456402	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Mia...?
L456401	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	What was her name?  The one I met.
L456400	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Excuse me???
L456399	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	What was her name?
L456398	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	-- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?   What did your life mean?  Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love?
L456397	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	You did miss --
L456396	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
L456395	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	You did.
L456394	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Two: what if I didn't miss?
L456393	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Dad...
L456392	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
L456391	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	You taking any medication?
L456390	u7215	m486	ALEXANDER	To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
L456426	u7216	m486	MIA	So I can move on.  You too.
L456425	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Why?
L456421	u7216	m486	MIA	What?
L456420	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Then you get it.  You'll understand.
L456419	u7216	m486	MIA	I've been dreaming about this.
L456418	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Wait.  I want to tell you something.
L456417	u7216	m486	MIA	I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
L456379	u7216	m486	MIA	And glow happily ever after.
L456378	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
L456377	u7216	m486	MIA	Dysfunctional --
L456376	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
L456375	u7216	m486	MIA	She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
L456373	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
L456372	u7216	m486	MIA	No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
L456369	u7216	m486	MIA	Like now?
L456368	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	"That's what it asked me.  ""What do you want?""  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment."
L456367	u7216	m486	MIA	What did it want?
L456362	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
L456361	u7216	m486	MIA	Of what?
L456352	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	How?
L456351	u7216	m486	MIA	The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
L456350	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Nothing is real until it's perceived.
L456347	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	A quantum one.
L456346	u7216	m486	MIA	What universe are you in, Paul?
L456345	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Could be.
L456343	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
L456342	u7216	m486	MIA	We flopped the first time out.
L456341	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	It's an experiment.
L456340	u7216	m486	MIA	Why am I doing this?
L456339	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	That's the physicist's playground.
L456338	u7216	m486	MIA	A place you've never been.
L456337	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Where to?
L456336	u7216	m486	MIA	Could you?
L456335	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	I could go out of town.
L456334	u7216	m486	MIA	What?
L456333	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Okay.
L456332	u7216	m486	MIA	I'm heading out of town.
L456331	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	Could we go somewhere?
L456326	u7216	m486	MIA	Day or night?
L456325	u7217	m486	PENTCHO	I've been dreaming about you.
L650059	u8870	m603	AARON	Who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? They must see what the legacy has wrought - Diedre, withered inside herself Carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in Lashers grasp...   Maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
L650058	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
L650057	u8870	m603	AARON	You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
L650055	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But why would they do that...?
L650054	u8870	m603	AARON	With his hands!
L649960	u8870	m603	AARON	Two heartbeats.
L649959	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Two what...?
L649958	u8870	m603	AARON	There are two.
L649957	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I'm the doctor.
L649956	u8870	m603	AARON	Are you alright...?  You look pale.
L649818	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Lasher is my legacy - not Michael's.   Aaron, I've seen the pain in Michael.  I can't bear to see anymore.   He's not to know.  Swear to me.
L649817	u8870	m603	AARON	Lasher will act, Rowan.  Whatever it is he wants - he's waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  I don't like -
L649815	u8870	m603	AARON	But you've not told Michael.
L649814	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I have seen him again.  Last night.
L649794	u8870	m603	AARON	I've grown very fond of you you and Michael both.
L649793	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You've been shadowing the family for thirty years.  It's only fitting you give one af us away.
L649792	u8870	m603	AARON	Thank you for this honor, my dear.
L649661	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - you loved that house as a child.  You could work again! You could make it ours. We'll sweep out the horror.  And Lasher with it!
L649660	u8870	m603	AARON	Going away doesn't mean you leave Lasher behind. He was on Rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
L649651	u8870	m603	AARON	A spacial entity.  An organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
L649650	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Then what is he...?
L649649	u8870	m603	AARON	Many times over the past thirty years. Why he shows himself to me, I don't know but Lasher's not some mindless wraith.
L650156	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You have to warn her - this second! I'm catching the next flight back!
L650155	u8870	m603	AARON	Rowan...
L650152	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	He chose ME for ROWAN --- when I was a child!
L650151	u8870	m603	AARON	What are you talk---
L650150	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
L650141	u8870	m603	AARON	Every day  twice.
L650140	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I'll probably be back in a week...but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day...?
L650138	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
L650137	u8870	m603	AARON	Nothing was ever more false.
L650136	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
L650053	u8870	m603	AARON	Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
L650052	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Go back, Michael.  Do what you can...
L650051	u8870	m603	AARON	What have the witches always asked of you...?
L650004	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
L650003	u8870	m603	AARON	Michael, Rowan should -
L650002	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Don't tell Rowan about this.
L649752	u8870	m603	AARON	Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
L649751	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan.
L649750	u8870	m603	AARON	There is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, Michael...?  what anchors your life...? Your work...?  Your creativity...?
L649749	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	No scaredy-cats in the Talamasca, huh...?
L649653	u8870	m603	AARON	A spirit.  Perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with Diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
L649652	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	A what...?
L649520	u8870	m603	AARON	Come.  There is a lot to read
L649519	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
L649517	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You sound certifiable. Yon know that.
L649516	u8870	m603	AARON	I ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  A few hours.
L649511	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
L649510	u8870	m603	AARON	With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
L649509	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	How do you know about Rowan ...?  I didn't --- Cemetery...?
L649508	u8870	m603	AARON	Rowan's already called the hotel, Michael.  At the cemetery by now, I would guess.
L649507	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Jesus I've got - to get to the ho--
L649952	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
L649951	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
L649787	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
L649786	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Then you wear it.
L649785	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
L649784	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't want it.
L649783	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Always give the crovd a taste, darling.  Now - Ryan said I'm supposed to make sure -
L649719	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	In the bayou, they have a saying... 'You choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   Darling, I'd say you're on a roll.
L649718	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Mm-hmm.    Seems & lot longer.
L649717	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	You two sees like a perfect fit.   Only two mounths...?
L649705	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Nothing worse than a common tool.
L649704	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Aren't they gauche...?   Those steel things are so - common.
L649703	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
L649702	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He made that quite clear, yes.
L649701	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
L649480	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I want to see my mother.
L649479	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Rowan - I'm Beatrice Maytair.  Your cousin.  Deedee...you'r mother and I - we - we grew up together.
L649802	u8875	m603	GIFFORD	Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
L649801	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
L649800	u8875	m603	GIFFORD	"I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - ""make us rich"" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'"
L649799	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
L649497	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
L649496	u8875	m603	GIFFORD	In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
L649495	u8871	m603	BEATRICE	Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
L649609	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm NOT like you!  I'm NOT! You're cruel -
L649608	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Did you like it...? Looking down at Graham and knowing what you could do...?
L649606	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
L649605	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You - are - a - murderer.
L649604	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
L649603	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You're mad!  Your mind is sick!
L649602	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	And that is why I pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
L649599	u8880	m603	ROWAN	ENOUGH!!!
L649598	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
L649597	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Stop it!
L649596	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
L649595	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It wes a dream...!
L649594	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Lasher touched you and you loved it.
L649591	u8880	m603	ROWAN	'He'...?
L649590	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
L649589	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	You have the Mayfair eyes.   Tell me, Rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can't fathom...?
L649588	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Why are you doing this...?  Handing out these horrors! Why...?!!
L649587	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. Head split open like a melon.
L649586	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You're a monster.
L649585	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	She didn't feel them
L649584	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
L649573	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
L649572	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Better than most, I suppose.
L649571	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
L649570	u8880	m603	ROWAN	The lamplight.  That's all.
L649569	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	What is it...?
L649546	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	And this - if you decide to take the rest.
L649545	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Eighty million doll --- ?
L649544	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
L649543	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't want the -
L649526	u8880	m603	ROWAN	There are things I have to know!
L649525	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	I'm tired.  I need to rest.
L649524	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
L649523	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
L649522	u8880	m603	ROWAN	She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
L649486	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	In the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
L649485	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
L649484	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
L649454	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm coming down there!!  And it you put my mother in the ground betore I arrive, you'll wish you'd never seen my face!  IS THAT UNDERSTOOD...?!
L649453	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	Out of the question      Rowan, coming here will not change the -
L649452	u8880	m603	ROWAN	When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
L649451	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
L649450	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
L649449	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	It was quite warranted by the - situation.    I realize this is a shock, but really, Rowan - you never even knew her. It's not as if you've suffered some great -
L649448	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Who the hel1 -
L649447	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	I had you sent away.

L649445	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	I under5tand.  All the same
L649444	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But my mother...  Ellie said she died -

L649440	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't have any aunts - and I've never heard of a 'Carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'Diedre'!  Just who -
L649439	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	This is your aunt.  Carlotta Mayfair.  In New Orleans.
L649438	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Who is this...?
L649437	u8872	m603	CARLOTTA	When did she die...?
L649436	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I beg your par---

L650222	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
L650221	u8876	m603	LASHER	Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
L650191	u8876	m603	LASHER	Ju1ien was your father   Your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. All one in the same...  That is why he fought carlotta for your life.
L650190	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Oh god...
L650189	u8876	m603	LASHER	They want to come back.    We have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  The Mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  I have weaved you all together - from the start.   I brought Petyr Van Abel to Suzanne.  He had genius in him.  Scientific, precise.  It was a perfect start. And on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
L650188	u8880	m603	ROWAN	The portraits, Lasher.  Why are the witches always before a door...? Tell me, Lasher.  Now!
L650187	u8876	m603	LASHER	It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
L650186	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
L650111	u8876	m603	LASHER	Tell me what I am, Rowan.
L650110	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No!
L650105	u8876	m603	LASHER	That is what you must discover.   see what I am, my love. With all your power - see me, and know what I am.
L650104	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I don't know what you are!!!
L650103	u8876	m603	LASHER	There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
L650102	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
L650101	u8876	m603	LASHER	I do not understand...
L650100	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
L650099	u8876	m603	LASHER	What is wrong...?
L650098	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Leave me alone!
L650097	u8876	m603	LASHER	Go on. Rowan.  Go on.
L650078	u8876	m603	LASHER	Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
L650077	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Only you...
L650076	u8876	m603	LASHER	Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
L650075	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
L650074	u8876	m603	LASHER	Then help me--- for his sake...
L650073	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I love Michael...
L650072	u8876	m603	LASHER	--- and I have heard you from the beginning... from it's very first beat.
L650070	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But have I...?  Ever...?!
L650069	u8876	m603	LASHER	I've waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  Do you know what it's like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  I did not choose to be such as this!  Suzanne brought me here.  She called to me!
L650066	u8876	m603	LASHER	No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
L650065	u8880	m603	ROWAN	And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
L650064	u8876	m603	LASHER	I only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but Marguerite could not help me.  Nor Julien...
L650063	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I know that you're evil.
L649989	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
L649988	u8876	m603	LASHER	Do not tell me that!
L649987	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I LOVE him!
L649986	u8876	m603	LASHER	But I could understand. I want to understand!
L649985	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
L649984	u8876	m603	LASHER	you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
L649982	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It's too soon to know.
L649981	u8876	m603	LASHER	A girl...?
L649980	u8876	m603	LASHER	From the night on the moor, when I was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a Mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and Deborah.  Stella - Marguerite - Antha  - Diedre -  All of them.  And you will have a child...
L649979	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
L649978	u8876	m603	LASHER	If that were true, I would not be here.
L649977	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Go away!  I don't want you here.
L649976	u8876	m603	LASHER	There is no one here but the dead.
L649975	u8876	m603	LASHER	I bring her flowers too.
L649974	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
L649940	u8876	m603	LASHER	I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
L649939	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You're very clever, aren't you...?
L649937	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
L649936	u8876	m603	LASHER	If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
L649935	u8876	m603	LASHER	If you knew how I yearn for that...
L649934	u8880	m603	ROWAN	To love, you must be able to feel.
L649933	u8876	m603	LASHER	It is from love.
L649932	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Made it...?
L649930	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You bastard...
L649929	u8876	m603	LASHER	Explain this to me --- violated...?
L649928	u8880	m603	ROWAN	YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
L649927	u8876	m603	LASHER	I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
L649926	u8880	m603	ROWAN	The wasps were meant for Michael - but there's only so much you can control, isn't there?  The great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  Why would you hurt him...?!  Answer me.
L649833	u8876	m603	LASHER	Always loved you..

L649826	u8876	m603	LASHER	Like this...?
L649825	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Yes, Michael.  Harder--.  More...
L649770	u8876	m603	LASHER	There are things you will not tell him.
L649769	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Lie...?
L649768	u8876	m603	LASHER	You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
L650244	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I know.    you are my son -
L650243	u8877	m603	LASHER THE MAN	I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
L650239	u8877	m603	LASHER THE MAN	'Kill you...?'  You are my mother.  Do you think I would hurt you...?
L650238	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
L650237	u8877	m603	LASHER THE MAN	ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
L650236	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
L650218	u8877	m603	LASHER THE MAN	How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
L650217	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Put - him - down!  His - his heart...

L650125	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
L650124	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
L650123	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!

L649725	u8880	m603	ROWAN	If we married, we'd shut him out forever.
L649724	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Maybe he's just - waiting...
L649723	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
L649722	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.

L649655	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
L649654	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Stop looking at me like that! I'm not some siren chanting to the moon.  And my life is not a cosmic whim!  I am in charge of my life -  - and I want to stay.  Everything that was taken from me is here, Michael. All these years, she was there without me.  Helpless. I should have been here.
L649643	u8880	m603	ROWAN	But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
L649642	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!

L649638	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
L649637	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.

L649635	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It could've been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  Maybe -
L649633	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	- a witch.
L649632	u8880	m603	ROWAN	She - she said I - I was a ---
L649631	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.

L649464	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Wait a minute.  Rowan - what is going on...?

L649417	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You could fly down tomorrow.  I could be there the next day  I think I can last that long without you.
L649415	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
L649414	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	God knows, I'm intriguing.
L649413	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I called Dr. Styles at the Neurological Institute  In L.A., remember...?  He said he'd see you.  He was intrigned.

L649411	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Seems more like a year than a month.

L649404	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm serious.  You don't -
L649403	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
L649402	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
L649401	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You don't know what you meant -  because you don't know me.
L649400	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	All I meant was -
L649399	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
L649397	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Captain's orders.
L649396	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Doctor's orders- - -?

L649389	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You look very deep when you do that.  It's interesting.  We're Complete opposites-  I'd never just sit and wait for insparation.  I'd skip my turn and swap some letters.
L649386	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It's come to that, huh...?  Three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
L649385	u8880	m603	ROWAN	you touched him --- and saw him...? What was he doinging.  Kinky...?
L649384	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	He fools around with his patients too.
L649383	u8880	m603	ROWAN	He's very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
L649380	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Mm-hmm.     Scared-  I feel a little like the moth and the flame.
L649379	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Too much... too fast...?
L649378	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
L649377	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Really...?  Your family there...?
L649376	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I was born, in New Orleans, too-
L649374	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You still feel that crazy...?

L649367	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	It - it feels like - like I'm being filled up. crowded out of myself.   Like I'm fading away-
L649366	u8880	m603	ROWAN	It's unbelievable that you can do that.
L649365	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You knelt there, helpless-  You couldn't save him.   There was so such anger in you-.   Death infuriates you...
L649364	u8880	m603	ROWAN	My uncle.  Graham.  He and my Aunt, Ellie raised me.  He - he - had a stroke-  Just before Ellie died - of cancer. Last year.
L649363	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
L649362	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What else did you see- Michael...?

L649355	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Harder...
L649348	u8880	m603	ROWAN	No. I'm not.  Doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
L649347	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
L649346	u8880	m603	ROWAN	You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
L649345	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	The one time I want it to work...
L649344	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Just one.  The bar's closed.
L649343	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
L649342	u8880	m603	ROWAN	What do you see...?
L649339	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
L649338	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
L649336	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Then call it in. Mr. Curry. Whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I'm in the life business - remember..?
L649335	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	My jury's still out on that,
L649334	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I'm glad you're around to say it.
L649333	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I don't remember you at all-  You - you saved my life-  Bizarre thing to say, isn't it...?
L649332	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
L649331	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
L649330	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I guess so.  The trick is remembering how to act like one.  I'm glad you called, Mr. Curry. I wanted to see you.  Why don't we go to my office...
L649329	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	They like you ------- kids.
L650085	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Just don't fall off any ladders.
L650084	u8883	m603	STU	A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
L650019	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
L650018	u8883	m603	STU	Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
L650017	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I'm getting --- left behind.
L649780	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Just nervous.  Getting married, you know.     Got the rings...?

L649673	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
L649672	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
L649671	u8883	m603	STU	Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
L649315	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Go away, GODDAMNIT!

L649313	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	On which planet...?
L649312	u8883	m603	STU	Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
L649311	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
L649274	u8879	m603	MICHAEL	I just - hate it when they're - finished.
L649273	u8883	m603	STU	sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
L650087	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
L650086	u8883	m603	STU	Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
L649910	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Is that what you were doing...?
L649909	u8883	m603	STU	Is that a crack about our singing...?
L649908	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I thought it was 'whistle while you work.

L649680	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?

L649678	u8880	m603	ROWAN	Rowan Mayfair.
L649743	u8880	m603	ROWAN	I plan on liquidating almost evetything.
